# Digital-writing-folio

Biographical note - This Folio encompasses 12 weeks of work. From readings to the digital frustrations of coding and finally the end result of my interactive fiction piece called Rabbit. Each week is borken down into there number variables 1-12 with prototypes up the top with all my links to show the works failures and successes.
