At the moment, I'm trying to create a GitHub website, as doing such a thing will allow me to create the scroll animation effect. I'm using Visual Studio Code, but I am having problems with the website.

As each time I put it in, this comes up:

I'm going to leave this for now and come back to it later, once I have a more concrete idea of what I want to do.
Today in class we will work through reflective and mapping exercises help you confirm the scope of your piece, and identify key tasks that you need to develop and resolve it. Your final work must be a complete work, not a prototype, with ideas that have been introduced, developed and resolved.

In Assessment 2 you have introduced these ideas. Our activity today will help you to identify what needs to be developed and how to resolve your piece within the timeframe you have got.

The length/scope/scale of the work must be clarified and confirmed by the end of this week.

Reflection on Feedback and Peer Presentations Required activity for final folio (can be completed anytime this week)

What has been introduced? Summarise your proposed piece

What are the themes and ideas is your piece is exploring?:
What literary genre or style are you drawing on? Is it narrative driven or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic?
succinctly: What is the story? Or, what do you want to express/communicate through this piece?
what do you wish there reader to understand of feel?
What needs to be developed?

what drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?

how does the digital feed into this momentum?

how does the literary and the digital drive the momentum together with the piece’s thematics?

do you need to develop the story/concept/narrative further in order to answer the above questions? how will you do this? By mapping? By writing it out?

Exercise Now you have introduced your piece and some prototype pages, it can be a good idea to step off the digital platform and fully scope your ideas through writing, or drawing, or a simple form of digital mapping (like Miro). Something that gives you some flow away from the tech.

Here is a template you might like to use(PASSWORD: template) This is adapted from a Design Thinking tool that puts the audience experience within the concept development. Also in PDF on Canvas print it out in A3 (A4 will be too small)

You need to find the edges of your piece to know how much you need to do to develop and resolve it. That means drafting/mapping the whole thing if you have not done so already at this stage it is important that this is done in detail. You can use the template above or another kind of map. If you use a physical medium take photos and pop them in a sharefolder linked to your Github folio. Quite a few people showed how they are usin colour coding in miro to think through the different threads of their pieces.

Once you have further mapped/drafted you piece, ask yourself what do you need to do to resolve it?

Scope and Scale

how many words will it be?
how many screens?
what do you need to do on a week-by-week basis (is this realistic?)
what is the tech that might get you stuck? what is the workaround/Plan B?
what else might be an obstacle? flag it early with Jenny and Lucinda


Prototype 2: 


Was trying to add an image over the top of my background 

Tried this first 

<img src= "https://img.freepik.com/premium-vector/cute-vector-illustration-bunny-children-book_925324-13443.jpg?semt=ais_hybrid&w=740">

But the whole entire image came up which isn’t what I wanted.


Tried to change the background for just one page to rabbit 
Tried this first

tw-story[tags~="Rabbit"] {
 background-image:url("https://i.pinimg.com/originals/58/b4/6c/58b46c4023b9a4497df9b9a7f9b29b67.gif");
 background-size:cover;
}

file:///Users/isabellatattersall/Downloads/Rabbit%20(16).html 

Didn’t work

To fix it I then went to the style sheet and added a new code sequence 

tw-story[tags~="Rabbit"] {
 background-image:url("https://i.pinimg.com/originals/58/b4/6c/58b46c4023b9a4497df9b9a7f9b29b67.gif");
 background-size:cover;
}

That worked!
