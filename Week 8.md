Assignment 2 - process of creating the final piece.

At the moment, I'm trying to create a GitHub website, as doing such a thing will allow me to create the scroll animation effect. I'm using Visual Studio Code, but I am having problems with the website.

As each time I put it in, this comes up:

I'm going to leave this for now and come back to it later, once I have a more concrete idea of what I want to do.
Today in class, we will work through reflective and mapping exercises to help you confirm the scope of your piece and identify key tasks that you need to develop and resolve. Your final work must be complete, not a prototype, with ideas that have been introduced, developed and resolved.


The length/scope/scale of the work: I want this completed by the end of this week. I am mostly finished it and now I am just touching up the design elements and wording of the piece. 

Reflection on Feedback and Peer Presentations Required activity for final folio (can be completed anytime this week)

A: Since I wasn't here for the week of proposals, I will comment instead on the first assignment. I was incredibly impressed with the level of attention to detail each person put forward and how each one was so different from the next, while I understand that that was the point as we had choose our own E lit collection piece, it was just very interesting how each person took the assingment and decided to present it to the class. I would be curious to know if the content chosen in that first assignment was relfective of what each student made in there final assingment. 

What has been introduced? Summarise your proposed piece

What are the themes and ideas is your piece is exploring?:

A: This was mentioned and discussed in the week before.
What literary genre or style are you drawing on? Is it narrative driven or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic?: 

A: I am drawing on a narrative driven work with a poetic prose twist. 


What needs to be developed?

what drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?

A: This was covered in a week or two before, but I will repeat: It is the need to find the end but which is what the players need to decide for themselves.

how does the digital feed into this momentum?

A: Due to my story being based around AI it is quite literally poetic to have it as a interactive story which is the main momentum of the story.

how does the literary and the digital drive the momentum together with the piece’s thematic?

A: Both share the space and amplify issues together - problems of the age, which include the digital world, loneliness, etc.

do you need to develop the story/concept/narrative further in order to answer the above questions? how will you do this? By mapping? By writing it out?

A: I go into more depth earlier on about how I wish to develop the piece under my Miro link.

Scope and Scale

Answered in the earlier weeks as I started rather early developing my work.


Prototype 2 breakdown: 


Was trying to add an image over the top of my background 

Tried this first 

<img src= "https://img.freepik.com/premium-vector/cute-vector-illustration-bunny-children-book_925324-13443.jpg?semt=ais_hybrid&w=740">

But the whole entire image came up which isn’t what I wanted.


Tried to change the background for just one page to rabbit 
Tried this first

tw-story[tags~="Rabbit"] {
 background-image:url("https://i.pinimg.com/originals/58/b4/6c/58b46c4023b9a4497df9b9a7f9b29b67.gif");
 background-size:cover;
}

file:///Users/isabellatattersall/Downloads/Rabbit%20(16).html 

Didn’t work

To fix it I then went to the style sheet and added a new code sequence 

tw-story[tags~="Rabbit"] {
 background-image:url("https://i.pinimg.com/originals/58/b4/6c/58b46c4023b9a4497df9b9a7f9b29b67.gif");
 background-size:cover;
}

That worked!
