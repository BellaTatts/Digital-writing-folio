Today we will look at interactive fiction in games. You are not required to include games code from today in your folio. We understand that you have experimented with so much code already.

We will play through a number of Bitsy examples (which will be added to the repo later) and reflect on the affordances of tiny games.

Class discussion

How does Bitsy's technical constraint of 8x8 pixel art and limited colour palettes affect narrative possibilities and expression? In particular, how have these been used to elicit emotional response to themes around memory and grief?
In what ways do spatial navigation and environmental storytelling function differently in Bitsy games compared to other e-lit forms? What does this ask of the reader/player?
How can we make use various game features (e.g., character interactions triggering text, having scenes “loop” differently with each subsequent play) to make a game “literary”, with a compelling emotional timbre?
We will play with the online Bitsy Game Maker, drawing upon our new games resources page. You can follow Jenny's recorded Bitsy tutorial for the basics of editing a Bitsy game and publishing through GitHub pages.

Jenny has also recorded a quick video tutorial that will take you through the through the instructions for Inform 7.

Since Assessment Two is coming up, think about whether there is any tech that you need to know to make your creative prototype for your presentation. We will have time in class today to troubleshoot any of the coding that we have covered so far.

Assessment 2 is happening as soon as we come back from the Mid Term break. Please ensure that you have done the activities from Wednesday classes Weeks 5 and 6 this will really help you develop your concept and plans.

Today's class will be a working session. I would really like to see everyone's concept/story mapping so far (see week 5 activity) and plans toward Ass 2, including an achievable list of things to do over the break. Jenny and I won't be available for trouble shooting as we will be on leave so it's important you plan out what you need to do and contingencies for what you will present.

Here is a feedback form that we would really appreciate you filling out. You can tell us how you are going and anything specific you need to realise your goals and ideas in the second part of semester.

Assessment 1 Results are now released and so you'll be able to make a point of taking on this feedback for your second presentation.
