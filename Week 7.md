Bitsy game example 1: Novena

Very similar to House on the Hill with its graphics and use of space bar and computer arrows. I thought it was also smart how it used purple as the defining colour and yellow as the markers to help the viewer know where to go. It is a clean-cut story. I also liked how we can see the comments below of what other people thought.



Bitsy game example 2: The mountain is as it always was

It is a reflective piece of what is means to be alive. It is the same style as the one above, just with different images and a storyline. I did enjoy some of the effects which came with the story, like the wave-like movement which was a transition element to another section. 



Class discussion

**How does Bitsy's technical constraint of 8x8 pixel art and limited colour palettes affect narrative possibilities and expression? In particular, how have these been used to elicit emotional response to themes around memory and grief?**

A: The first key thing is that, like most stories, repetition can only go so far until it becomes boring, and while each story is unique to itself, words can only get you so far and images with the same pixilated quality and colouring start to blur together and become less distinguishing. Narrative-wise wise these stories stand apart, but even just from looking at these two, I can see that creating emotionally tying stories can make works repetitive. But again repetitive doesn't have to be bad, for such things like memory and grief, it is those sorts of elements which can make a work more effective as similarity can be attributed to familiarity. 


**In what ways do spatial navigation and environmental storytelling function differently in Bitsy games compared to other e-lit forms? What does this ask of the reader/player?**

A: While Bitsy is a unique medium, it does share some key features with other e-lit forms, such as hypertext fiction and interactive fiction (IF). However, due to its low-fi, pixel-based design and simplified interface, they require a different mode of interaction compared to other E lit forms and require players to engage with the story in other ways. The Spatial navigation of Bitsy is once again unique. Spatial navigation, in simple terms, is the player's ability to move in a space and for Bitzy, it is often a controlled environment and usually uses a grid-like structure, meaning players can only move in certain directions rather than wherever they want to go.

**How can we make use various game features (e.g., character interactions triggering text, having scenes “loop” differently with each subsequent play) to make a game “literary”, with a compelling emotional timbre?**

A: I think it is completely plausible to make the game literary. Connection and interaction will be able to do this, so using various game features like character interaction or transitional elements can make a piece more symbolically relevant and more aesthetically appealing for readers. I think as well that the emotional points are key to making something literary. For most books it is the coonections we form with it which make it last as long as it does.

Electronic Literature (e-lit)

I feel my work has a strong connection to electronic literature theory, particularly the ideas of N. Katherine Hayles, who argues that in digital environments, "text becomes dynamic, procedural, and performative." I would like to think that my work is as much a performance as it is a visual journey from a world of virtual reality made to feel like the real world. 

Twine is great at helping to do this by making the story non-linear, where the player must work their way through and attempt to find the best ending.

Hypertext & Post-Structuralism

Inspired by theorists like Roland Barthes and Espen Aarseth, my story treats the narrative as non-hierarchical; it rejects a single “true” path, which is an important characteristic because AI is all about multiple pathways that use a single algorithm. Barthes’ concept of the writerly text — where the reader constructs meaning — is central to my own story, which is not only about the characters' journey but the players' journey to understanding a world that incorporates themes like climate change.

Concept & Creative Goal 
In this story, the player believes they are running in a forest when, in actuality, they are stuck in a VR meant to look like it, and something is looking for them. 
There's no memory of logging in, no menu, no logout button.
No NPCs (non-player characters) but a creature that seems scarily sentient.
The more you continue the more information you get about what is going on and who will succeed. t
I want to create a feeling of being stuck in a game but not through action sequences, but through narrative dissonance and limited control.

3. Draft Creative Work / Prototype Demo 

Here’s a quick look at the prototype:

The first passage jumps right in and feels like the player has truly just woken up in a forest. Each choice after that will have a sequence of choices to pick from, which will then utilise hypertext to move the story along. One key thing I want to add in there is a continue button, which is required to be pressed in order to get a certain ending.
Some choices loop back to the beginning. 
There are over 18 passages, with two main endings:
Escape, killed, planet restored. 


4. Planning & Development Process 

Stage 1: Concept and Writing

Developed a branching story based on 3 core ideas:
Loss of identity in virtual spaces
Looped time which is faster than the outside world
death in the real world vs death in the virtual one

Stage 2: Twine Structure

Used Harlow for the best format.

Stage 3: Testing & Feedback

Add more “visible” consequences to player choices. Hence the multi-ending.

5. Market Research & Creative Relevance

I have already touched on this but Twine doesn't have any fees attached to it, I did go into a bit more depth on a previous week on Padlet about what going professional would look like and fees were attached. 

I did want to do AI, however, because there is a lot of it being mentioned currently, Black Mirror, as well ad the past icons The Matrix, or SOMA, and I wanted to put my own spin on it

This project appeals to:

Young adults exploring identity and mental health in online spaces, while it is based around AI, it can also be a symbolic reference to those stuck in the digital world who feel like thier life revolves around their phone.
There’s also educational potential — it raises critical questions about AI, consent, memory, and control.

I’m excited to keep refining it and would love your feedback!

**Things to do over break:**

Clean up codes - make sure images are in place and all the codes I have put in are working correctly.




#### Readings

### **The Paradox of Poetic Gaming: evidence of everything exploding:** 

This chapter discusses playable media which we have penned as games but has material which is linguistic or poetic in nature, but don’t retract from the overall gaming experience. However the use of such language does alter the game by replacing core elements  with textual material that requires more attention. 

So if it is more word orientated then a game it stays but the rules have to change. So does it really count as a game if it follows the same pattern a game does but contains nothing internally that resembles what we are used to?

This piece is really a commentary on how gaming as a rulebound structure with a goal driven system can be successfully implemented with something as ambiguous and emotionally demanding as poetry. Its also interesting how we are so driven to break down the capitalist culture of gaming by altering the game itself.

Similarly when we discuss the arts and its connection to poetic gaming we can see that
"…the Situationists demanded that play should permeate all areas of life by blending playfulness and creativity and by appropriating and subverting “not only . . . game features, assigning to them new properties, but also . . . concepts and ideas, assigning to them new meanings” "

Ensslin A (2014). The Paradox of Poetic Gaming: evidence of everything exploding, Literary Gaming. Accessed 1 June. https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/3037/chapter-standard/82967/The-Paradox-of-Poetic-Gaming-evidence-of

Without play there is no game and maybe the point of poetry is to revitalise parts of gaming that have become repetitive. It is also discussed that a poetry game is only considered a game if specifically named - ie Marko Niemi's piece Stud poetry. 

For specifically Ensslin uses EoEE as a marker for this revolution. She believes that the existence of such games - poetry and gaming mechanics is not to ruin the gaming form but to have viewers engage more deeply with the content rather then the goal driven system. We are trying to create new strands of storytelling and artistic expression, not to dismiss the past works. But like the resto f the world that is evolving, our writing practise must revolve alongside it.

### **Poetic Playlands: Poetry, Interface, and Video Game Engines:**

From what I gather poetry while evidently popular seems to hold stronger sway when mixed with game mechanics. Its can interesting concept poetic games, because its creation is an attempt at revitalising the old and the new, or rather the modern with the trending. Nelson's essay explores the point in which poetry and gaming meet, and that like poetry a game can be analysed through a literary lens. From reading it and other past weeks works one thing that always seems to pop up is how our perception of a work is in the end what determines the genre or type it fits into. Paper, computer, linear, non linear etc. So while poetry is the more nuanced subject its longevity has meant it will continue to stay, what we don’t know is the affect it will have on everything else. At the moment gaming whilst prominent in pop culture cannot be considered a true art form, so, if we were to include the rules of poetry how would that affect the gaming world.

Not only that how would it change the player interface? Poetry is a highly emotive writing form, to include it into something as goal orientated as a game could affect the playing style, the way it is setup, but would that we for the better or worse? And if we did it would it still count as a game or interactive fiction - a title with a working definition?


Does poetry allow for more creativity due to games starting to become repetitive? 

It might also mean that poetry is becoming more accessible and readable due to games inferring their own sort of spin on the work. And since poetry is so subjective it is open to interpretation.

**Summary of game, game, game and again game + i made this. you play this. we are enemies:** 

game, game, game and again game (gggag) is a digital artwork that combines retro-style game, personal poetic expression, and anti-design statement. Drawn by hand with charcoal and coloured pencils, it's goal is to break away from the clean-esque style that comes from the typical  digital art. The piece purposefully critiques the problems of Western systems which doesn’t embrace the human parts of art ie the messy and the vulnerable.
Rather than using more traditional gameplay like scoring or skill, the artwork is instead meant to be an inward journey through different belief systems—faith, capitalism, chemistry, real estate, etc. Each branch or level utilises interactive elements like poetry, animations, videos, and broken sounds to explore how personal worldviews shift over time.
The artwork is adamant in removing concept of perfection that ai tools use, and instead strives to highlights imperfections and hand made parts to feel more like a sketchbook than a completed product. Embedded within the piece are also personal comments complied together  in archival home videos to further customise the experience, connecting the artist’s thoughts with broader philosophical reflections.

i made this. you play this. we are enemies whilst using similar techniques to create its final product - pulls from different sources to create a sort of collage look whihc still retains that done by hand look - does look at more the concept of authorship. The internet for all is wonders can often be repeats of the same thing. When I say this I mean not only what we search for but the content which comes up from said search. Another problem is that once on the internet who gets ownership of the work? and since it is on the internet does that mean anyone is allowed to access it and use it in their own work?

Ultimately, gggag and i made this. you play this. we are enemies was made to confront users interpretive filters and western ideologies by offering something which is raw and real.
