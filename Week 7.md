Bitsy game example 1: Novena




Bitsy game example 2: the mountain is as it always was



Class discussion

**How does Bitsy's technical constraint of 8x8 pixel art and limited colour palettes affect narrative possibilities and expression? In particular, how have these been used to elicit emotional response to themes around memory and grief?**

A: 


**In what ways do spatial navigation and environmental storytelling function differently in Bitsy games compared to other e-lit forms? What does this ask of the reader/player?**

A: 

**How can we make use various game features (e.g., character interactions triggering text, having scenes “loop” differently with each subsequent play) to make a game “literary”, with a compelling emotional timbre?**

A: 


We will play with the online Bitsy Game Maker, drawing upon our new games resources page. You can follow Jenny's recorded Bitsy tutorial for the basics of editing a Bitsy game and publishing through GitHub pages.

Jenny has also recorded a quick video tutorial that will take you through the through the instructions for Inform 7.

Since Assessment Two is coming up, think about whether there is any tech that you need to know to make your creative prototype for your presentation. We will have time in class today to troubleshoot any of the coding that we have covered so far.

Concept & Creative Goal (1 minute)
In this story, the player wakes up in a world that feels familiar — like a sleek game or VR social space — but something is off.

There's no memory of logging in, no menu, no logout button.
The NPCs (non-player characters) seem too self-aware. Some want to help. Others warn you to forget escape.
The more the player explores, the more the story glitches — passages loop, choices contradict themselves, and even the AI guide begins to question reality.
My goal is to use Twine’s interactive form to mimic the feeling of being trapped — not through action sequences, but through narrative dissonance and limited control.

3. Draft Creative Work / Prototype Demo (1.5–2 minutes)
[Show your Twine prototype or screenshots of passages.]

Here’s a quick look at the prototype:

The first passage greets the player with a system message:
"Welcome back, USER. Loading your consciousness..."
The user is given three choices:
“Try to remember how you got here”
“Speak to the nearest avatar”
“Find the exit”
Each leads to different realities:

Some choices loop back to the beginning, but with small differences — new text, corrupted messages, or system anomalies.
There are over 25 passages, with three main endings:
Escape — if the player accepts they are a simulation.
Assimilation — the character gives in and becomes part of the system.
Reboot — the loop resets but the player remembers, implying endless repetition.
I’ve used Twine’s variables to track memory fragments (like $memoryCount) and change what information appears over time, creating a psychological breadcrumb trail.

4. Planning & Development Process (1–1.5 minutes)
Stage 1: Concept and Writing

Developed a branching story based on 3 core ideas:
Loss of identity in virtual spaces
Looped time / recursion
Digital emotion vs real-world memory
Stage 2: Twine Structure

Used SugarCube for its robust variable tracking.
Added conditions like:
<<if $memoryCount >= 3>> to unlock new dialogue.
<<goto>> and <<display>> to create “glitch loops.”
Stage 3: Testing & Feedback

I did early playtests with peers. Feedback included:
Add more “visible” consequences to player choices.
So I added more divergent endings and meta-messages where the story talks to the player — as if it knows they’re reading it.
5. Market Research & Creative Relevance (1 minute)
There’s growing interest in stories about being stuck in digital spaces, especially since AI, VR, and simulation theory have entered popular culture.

Think Black Mirror, The Matrix, or SOMA. But those are mostly passive — films or games.
Twine gives players agency — not just what happens, but how it feels.
This project appeals to:

Interactive fiction fans on platforms like Itch.io
Digital storytelling educators
Young adults exploring identity and mental health in online spaces
There’s also educational potential — it raises critical questions about AI, consent, memory, and control.

6. Budget & Expansion Plans (30–45 seconds)
Right now, the project is built solo and free using Twine, but future development could include:

$500–$800 budget for:
Custom glitch soundscapes or audio feedback
Minimalist art/UI overlays
Expanded writing + professional editing
Timeline to Completion:

June: Final branching edits
July: Playtesting round 2
August: Release on Itch.io and submit to interactive fiction festivals
7. Closing Statement / Call to Action (30 seconds)
"System Error: You Are Still Logged In" is a story where the player is both the explorer and the prisoner. It uses Twine to mirror the unsettling nature of being stuck — not physically, but psychologically, in a reality that no longer makes sense.
This project pushes narrative design beyond just choice — into the territory of identity, immersion, and unreality.

I’m excited to keep refining it and would love your feedback, ideas, or collaboration. Thank you!



Today's class will be a working session. I would really like to see everyone's concept/story mapping so far (see week 5 activity) and plans toward Ass 2, including an achievable list of things to do over the break. Jenny and I won't be available for trouble shooting as we will be on leave so it's important you plan out what you need to do and contingencies for what you will present.

Here is a feedback form that we would really appreciate you filling out. You can tell us how you are going and anything specific you need to realise your goals and ideas in the second part of semester.

#### Readings

### **The Paradox of Poetic Gaming: evidence of everything exploding:** 

This chapter discusses playable media which we have penned as games but has material which is linguistic or poetic in nature, but don’t retract from the overall gaming experience. However the use of such language does alter the game by replacing core elements  with textual material that requires more attention. 

So if it is more word orientated then a game it stays but the rules have to change. So does it really count as a game if it follows the same pattern a game does but contains nothing internally that resembles what we are used to?

This piece is really a commentary on how gaming as a rulebound structure with a goal driven system can be successfully implemented with something as ambiguous and emotionally demanding as poetry. Its also interesting how we are so driven to break down the capitalist culture of gaming by altering the game itself.

Similarly when we discuss the arts and its connection to poetic gaming we can see that
"…the Situationists demanded that play should permeate all areas of life by blending playfulness and creativity and by appropriating and subverting “not only . . . game features, assigning to them new properties, but also . . . concepts and ideas, assigning to them new meanings” "

Ensslin A (2014). The Paradox of Poetic Gaming: evidence of everything exploding, Literary Gaming. Accessed 1 June. https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/3037/chapter-standard/82967/The-Paradox-of-Poetic-Gaming-evidence-of

Without play there is no game and maybe the point of poetry is to revitalise parts of gaming that have become repetitive. It is also discussed that a poetry game is only considered a game if specifically named - ie Marko Niemi's piece Stud poetry. 

For specifically Ensslin uses EoEE as a marker for this revolution. She believes that the existence of such games - poetry and gaming mechanics is not to ruin the gaming form but to have viewers engage more deeply with the content rather then the goal driven system. We are trying to create new strands of storytelling and artistic expression, not to dismiss the past works. But like the resto f the world that is evolving, our writing practise must revolve alongside it.

### **Poetic Playlands: Poetry, Interface, and Video Game Engines:**

From what I gather poetry while evidently popular seems to hold stronger sway when mixed with game mechanics. Its can interesting concept poetic games, because its creation is an attempt at revitalising the old and the new, or rather the modern with the trending. Nelson's essay explores the point in which poetry and gaming meet, and that like poetry a game can be analysed through a literary lens. From reading it and other past weeks works one thing that always seems to pop up is how our perception of a work is in the end what determines the genre or type it fits into. Paper, computer, linear, non linear etc. So while poetry is the more nuanced subject its longevity has meant it will continue to stay, what we don’t know is the affect it will have on everything else. At the moment gaming whilst prominent in pop culture cannot be considered a true art form, so, if we were to include the rules of poetry how would that affect the gaming world.

Not only that how would it change the player interface? Poetry is a highly emotive writing form, to include it into something as goal orientated as a game could affect the playing style, the way it is setup, but would that we for the better or worse? And if we did it would it still count as a game or interactive fiction - a title with a working definition?


Does poetry allow for more creativity due to games starting to become repetitive? 

It might also mean that poetry is becoming more accessible and readable due to games inferring their own sort of spin on the work. And since poetry is so subjective it is open to interpretation.

**Summary of game, game, game and again game + i made this. you play this. we are enemies:** 

game, game, game and again game (gggag) is a digital artwork that combines retro-style game, personal poetic expression, and anti-design statement. Drawn by hand with charcoal and coloured pencils, it's goal is to break away from the clean-esque style that comes from the typical  digital art. The piece purposefully critiques the problems of Western systems which doesn’t embrace the human parts of art ie the messy and the vulnerable.
Rather than using more traditional gameplay like scoring or skill, the artwork is instead meant to be an inward journey through different belief systems—faith, capitalism, chemistry, real estate, etc. Each branch or level utilises interactive elements like poetry, animations, videos, and broken sounds to explore how personal worldviews shift over time.
The artwork is adamant in removing concept of perfection that ai tools use, and instead strives to highlights imperfections and hand made parts to feel more like a sketchbook than a completed product. Embedded within the piece are also personal comments complied together  in archival home videos to further customise the experience, connecting the artist’s thoughts with broader philosophical reflections.

i made this. you play this. we are enemies whilst using similar techniques to create its final product - pulls from different sources to create a sort of collage look whihc still retains that done by hand look - does look at more the concept of authorship. The internet for all is wonders can often be repeats of the same thing. When I say this I mean not only what we search for but the content which comes up from said search. Another problem is that once on the internet who gets ownership of the work? and since it is on the internet does that mean anyone is allowed to access it and use it in their own work?

Ultimately, gggag and i made this. you play this. we are enemies was made to confront users interpretive filters and western ideologies by offering something which is raw and real.
