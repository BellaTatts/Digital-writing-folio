I am trying to add a theme, but I am struggling with how to go about that. I'm not sure if it is to do with adding another file or just an entirely new repository, but so far I have managed to alter the colouring to the light pink that I want, I may even just keep the structure as is but alter wording!

Readings
Ryan Ikeda's essay looks at how structural racism is embedded within the infrastructure of electronic literature. Ikeda uses  infrastructural critique to assess how databases, fellowships, publications, and literary histories that are contained within the e-lit community perpetuate clear racial hierarchies and privilege the white experience.

**Key Themes and Arguments**
Ikeda argues that white supremacy is something that embedded in the very structures that support e-lit and unfortunately continue to operate. This includes databases like the ELMCIP Knowledge Base, which, when you go to search for terms like "blackness" or "race," came up with zero results, highlighting how particular  discourses are marginalised or erased within the field. 

By addressing these issues we can then try and fix them or at least make readers more aware.

Today we will continue work on the creative development of your piece. You will work in small groups to workshop your concept and prototype pages asking your peers to consider the same questions you considered yourself last week:

None of the principles of the piece have changed, except that I am now using Harlow instead of Chapbook!
