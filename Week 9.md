I am trying to add a theme, but I am struggling with how to go about that. I'm not sure if it is to do with adding another file or just an entirely new repository, but so far I have managed to alter the colouring to the light pink that I want, I may even just keep the structure as is but alter wording!

Readings
Ryan Ikeda's essay, "Excavating Logics of White Supremacy in Electronic Literature: Antiracism as Infrastructural Critique", published in the Electronic Book Review in January 2021, offers a critical examination of how structural racism is embedded within the infrastructure of electronic literature (e-lit). Ikeda employs an infrastructural critique to analyze how databases, fellowships, publications, and literary histories within the e-lit community perpetuate racial hierarchies and privilege white experience.

Key Themes and Arguments
White Supremacy as Infrastructure: Ikeda argues that white supremacy operates not just through overt acts of racism but is embedded in the very structures that support e-lit. This includes databases like the ELMCIP Knowledge Base, which, upon searching for terms like "blackness" or "race," yielded zero results, highlighting how certain discourses are marginalized or erased within the field.

Antiracism as Infrastructural Critique: The essay positions antiracism as a necessary critique of the material and symbolic structures that uphold white supremacy in e-lit. Ikeda suggests that without addressing these foundational elements, initiatives aimed at equity and inclusion may inadvertently perpetuate existing power dynamics.

Rhetorical Analysis of E-Lit Structures: Ikeda employs rhetorical analysis to examine how e-lit infrastructures—such as databases, fellowships, and publications—function as persuasive acts that construct and affirm racialized hierarchies. This approach reveals how these structures not only reflect but also actively produce racial inequalities.

Implications for the E-Lit Community
Ikeda's critique challenges the e-lit community to confront the embedded logics of white supremacy within its infrastructures. By recognizing and addressing these structural issues, the field can move towards a more inclusive and equitable practice that genuinely reflects diverse voices and experiences. This essay serves as a call to action for scholars and practitioners to engage in antiracist practices that go beyond surface-level initiatives and delve into the foundational structures that shape the field.

Today we will continue work on the creative development of your piece. You will work in small groups to workshop your concept and prototype pages asking your peers to consider the same questions you considered yourself last week:

What are the themes and ideas the piece is exploring?
what drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?
how does the digital feed into this momentum?
what suggestions can you make for the reader experience?
Requirement for final folio (200 words minimum - can be done any time this week) Update your folio with a summary and reflection on the feedback you recieved and dot points for next steps with planned dates for doing it.
