Today we will focus on making author websites in Glitch using an easy-to-use template built by Jenny with the help of ChatGPT. We will publish our author sites through GitHub, assigning them the URL username.github.io, much like Jenny's author website is on jennyhedley.github.io. If you miss class, you can read about how to publish to your github.io page.

Here is the website which you can edit for your own purposes. You may also create your own design from scratch or with the help of AI.

Very important video notice re Publishing Your Coding Playground & Fixing ./style.css directory issues

We will cover the content from this video in class, however, if you miss class please watch this 5-minute clip. This video covers an important fix to the stylesheet directory which anticipates our work today building author websites and publishing them through GitHub pages. This is a coding solution you will want to be mindful of across any of your HTML/CSS projects published through GitHub, which involves changing the code in the <head> of your index.html file from <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css" /> to <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css" />. The dot before the /style.css becomes very important as soon as you claim your username.github.io webpage!

It is a requirement that you have published your version of the coding playground - which we worked on in Weeks 1–3 - and included it in your Assessment 3 folio which you should familiarise yourself with now. You will need to include the URL of both your GitHub repository for the playground, and one link either to the deployed site which you've published through GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify or other free host. Same for your author website, main project and other coding experiments.

In previous years, people have lost marks on the final assessment where they have said things like "I don't know how to publish my site". The multiple video recordings, such as the one above and the Twine image maps video that shows you how to create and publish a Twine project, are designed to help you overcome such hurdles. If you need a video recording of any other specific knowledge, please request it in advance. We will not be available for consultation beyond the final class on Wednesday 28th May so figure out what you need to know asap.


Today we will continue work on the creative development of your piece. You will work in small groups to workshop your concept and prototype pages asking your peers to consider the same questions you considered yourself last week:

What are the themes and ideas the piece is exploring?
what drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?
how does the digital feed into this momentum?
what suggestions can you make for the reader experience?
Requirement for final folio (200 words minimum - can be done any time this week) Update your folio with a summary and reflection on the feedback you recieved and dot points for next steps with planned dates for doing it.
