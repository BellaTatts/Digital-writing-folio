### Activities for the week

#### Toroko gorge - 
was an auto-read, where each line appeared one after the other. The full poem is not shown.
The lines from this nature poem invite readers to embark on a meditative journey through a famous canyon in Taiwanâ€™s Taroko National Park.

#### The gathering cloud - 
a creatively abstract piece of work with scientific and general knowledge interwoven to further enhance the read. I think this work was made to be both interesting and a way to learn. The highlighted red words give context although sometimes can be random it adds depth to the piece. 

The red words also give background into our th author has decided it should look, with the word saved in that context she imagines aisles and rows of amber and blue lights flashing and holding our email attachments. 

I like how it is set out in parts. With the front piece and then plate no 1, no 2 etc.
A combination of life and science meeting in the middle. 
one word can infer many different meanings.

Presentation of images that pop up worked well with the written words.


#### First draft of the revolution -  
An electronic book with a click button worded 'next page' to move between pages. 
Send letters to her husband, as well as options to change what is put into the letters, creatively it allows autonomy for the reader to decide how the sotry goes.

#### Shade - 

Here are the words that I found got a response:

**Get off futon 

Water plant 

Drink water

Eat

Turn off lamp

Look at mirror

Sleep!

### First impressions of this course
Complicated but a process that can be creatively beneficial to improving how readers interact with works of writing.  

## Digital Writing 

**What do you think digital writing is?**
A: A medium to use for writing, I am curious to see how coding impacts writing.

**What do you expect from the digital writing lab?**
A: To improve on skills I already have and reflect on how the digital world is affecting my writing.

## Your Writing

**What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?**
A: My writing falls into Fiction and Poetry mainly with some auto non-fiction as well. 

**What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?**
A: Putting pen to paper as soon as I have an idea, walking.

**Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?**
A: it's a more productive way of holding and then conforming information to what I want it to look like later on.

**How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?**
A: There is a constraint when the written world facilitiates my thoughts, I also find that I am having to broaden the types of writing I do, ie. computer and phone typing in order to fit into the modern world.

Literature, E literature and digital writing - 

**E lit def:** works with an important literary aspect that takes advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer".
**digital writing -** bring a work to life via external tools, sound visuals interactive
**Literature -** physical texts that can be archived and usually hold higher regard than that of Elit and digital writing.

**Difference between E lit and digital writing? -** Further, unlike e-books in which the reader moves from one page to another in a linear fashion, in many digital fictions, the reader has a role in constructing the narrative, either by selecting hyperlinks or by controlling a character's journey through the story world.

**first generation elit definition -** pre-internet early on to 1995 box of texts, and hyperlinks, 
**second generation definition -** 1995 onwards multi-modal capabilities of the web, early internet and de-emphasises the hypertext link. before social media
**third definition generation -** current society 

**deconstruct what you know about literature to try and define your version of ELit. Does it come down to what we validate as true work? -**
A: I would argue that anything being presented to the general pulbic b considered as true work. Whether or not the reader beleives it to be of quality is a subjective matter. Thus the inclusion of E lit is valid as it is just another way of presenting a story. I did define in my own ways what i think E lit is above.^


### Readings for the week, qoutes I picked up and general thoughts

**Decolonise E-literature -** _"Even when they are not self-consciously producing literature-- societal concepts of literature are still dominated by the genres and modes developed in the print world-- a huge amount of people have used these tools to produce writing that has stepped away from the page to cross over into electronic literature territory, and it's a crucial move. Whether they know it or not, they are producing third-generation electronic literature."_

this works could live in print but are instead published online, while digital writing encourages something further from the author and the reader.
