### Activities for the week

#### Toroko gorge - 
was an auto-read, where each line appeared one after the other. The full poem is not shown.
The lines from this nature poem invite readers to embark on a meditative journey through a famous canyon in Taiwan’s Taroko National Park.

#### The gathering cloud - 
a creatively abstract piece of work with scientific and general knowledge interwoven to further enhance the read. I think this work was made to be both interesting and a way to learn. The highlighted red words give context although sometimes can be random it adds depth to the piece. 

The red words also give background into our th author has decided it should look, with the word saved in that context she imagines aisles and rows of amber and blue lights flashing and holding our email attachments. 

I like how it is set out in parts. With the front piece and then plate no 1, no 2 etc.
A combination of life and science meeting in the middle. 
one word can infer many different meanings.

Presentation of images that pop up worked well with the written words.


#### First draft of the revolution -  
An electronic book with a click button worded 'next page' to move between pages. 
Send letters to her husband, as well as options to change what is put into the letters, creatively it allows autonomy for the reader to decide how the sotry goes.

#### Shade - 

Here are the words that I found got a response:

**Get off futon 

Water plant 

Drink water

Eat

Turn off lamp

Look at mirror

Sleep!

### First impressions of this course
Complicated but a process that can be creatively beneficial to improving how readers interact with works of writing.  

## Digital Writing 

**What do you think digital writing is?**
A: A medium to use for writing, I am curious to see how coding impacts writing.

**What do you expect from the digital writing lab?**
A: To improve on skills I already have and reflect on how the digital world is affecting my writing.

## Your Writing

**What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?**
A: My writing falls into Fiction and Poetry mainly with some auto non-fiction as well. 

**What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?**
A: Putting pen to paper as soon as I have an idea, walking.

**Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?**
A: it's a more productive way of holding and then conforming information to what I want it to look like later on.

**How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?**
A: There is a constraint when the written world facilitiates my thoughts, I also find that I am having to broaden the types of writing I do, ie. computer and phone typing in order to fit into the modern world.

Literature, E literature and digital writing - 

**E lit def:** works with an important literary aspect that takes advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer".
**digital writing -** bring a work to life via external tools, sound visuals interactive
**Literature -** physical texts that can be archived and usually hold higher regard than that of Elit and digital writing.

**Difference between E lit and digital writing? -** Further, unlike e-books in which the reader moves from one page to another in a linear fashion, in many digital fictions, the reader has a role in constructing the narrative, either by selecting hyperlinks or by controlling a character's journey through the story world.

**first generation elit definition -** pre-internet early on to 1995 box of texts, and hyperlinks, 
**second generation definition -** 1995 onwards multi-modal capabilities of the web, early internet and de-emphasises the hypertext link. before social media
**third definition generation -** current society 

**deconstruct what you know about literature to try and define your version of ELit. Does it come down to what we validate as true work? -**
A: I would argue that anything being presented to the general pulbic b considered as true work. Whether or not the reader beleives it to be of quality is a subjective matter. Thus the inclusion of E lit is valid as it is just another way of presenting a story. I did define in my own ways what i think E lit is above.^


### Readings for the week, qoutes I picked up and general thoughts


**E lit garden:**  Anna Nacher uses metaphors of gardening and permaculture to discuss how the electronic literature community might “undertake a significant attempt to re-weave e-literature’s histories and genealogies.' An interesting opinion which leans away from more western and Eurocentric literature to instead be inclusive to all. Nacher referred back to the idea that allowing E lit to grow without borders would allow for further growth, as well as respecting that anthing else that includes “policing, monitoring and banishing” are actions that produce a scholarly “field.” and thus form conditions much like the literary texts.

**Quote:** Even when they are not self-consciously producing literature-- societal concepts of literature are still dominated by the genres and modes developed in the print world-- a huge amount of people have used these tools to produce writing that has stepped away from the page to cross over into electronic literature territory, and it's a crucial move. Whether they know it or not, they are producing third generation electronic literature.


She also goes into who has a role in decolonising e lit and if the third generation should b included, seeing as e lit is a version of story which is dedicated to the screen rather than paper it seems imperative that the continuation of e lit be through third gen, although first and second gen are net based, continual growth and advancement in our world makes interactive fiction something new everytime a new gen picks it up, so while we can reflect on the past I think that to keep this practise alive we must keep expanding and moving forward.

**Decolonise E-literature -** _"Even when they are not self-consciously producing literature-- societal concepts of literature are still dominated by the genres and modes developed in the print world-- a huge amount of people have used these tools to produce writing that has stepped away from the page to cross over into electronic literature territory, and it's a crucial move. Whether they know it or not, they are producing third-generation electronic literature."_

this works could live in print but are instead published online, while digital writing encourages something further from the author and the reader.

**Electronic literature what is it:** I find it interesting that each time something new is created - paper, then technology, we instantly consider it to be the be all end all type of situation. When in actuality creation isn't and shouldn’t be defined by such restrictions. It is instead the medium we use and the ways in which we facilitate writing that can often times hold us back. Much like literature is restricted to paper - not all the time but when you think of the word, the old English version of paper and pen is often what comes to mind, or it does to me at least -  E lit is restricted to the digital world. And while some could argue that E lit, by word alone is just the digital version of literature, many would find the works being presented much to lacking, or rather something else entirely. So maybe there is reason to worry, or maybe this is just a change the digital world is forcing us to adapt too.  


**Quote:** Readers come to digital work with expectations formed by print, including extensive and deep tacit knowledge of letter forms, print conventions, and print literary modes. Of necessity, electronic literature must build on these expectations even as it modifies and transforms them. At the same time, because electronic literature is normally created and performed within a context of networked and programmable media, it is also informed by the powerhouses of contemporary culture, particularly computer games, films, animations, digital arts, graphic design, and electronic visual culture.

Another interesting thought is how we 'save' the works, and in a way what we consider to be 'safe' ports for our work. For the physical literature, libraries were created to house such goods, but it get complicated when we involve the non tangible goods. The internet is very good at sucking things in and making them disappear with enough time, so how do you stock internet based literature and does its quality reduce if you cant save it somewhere? In a way what im trying to say is, if your work is just a passing thing in the grand scheme of works, is it worth saving?

**Quote:** Over the centuries, print literature has developed mechanisms for its preservation and archiving, including libraries and librarians, conservators, and preservationists. Unfortunately, no such mechanisms exist for electronic literature. The situation is exacerbated by the fluid nature of digital media; whereas books printed on good quality paper can endure for centuries, electronic literature routinely becomes unplayable (and hence unreadable) after a decade or even less.

**The origins of electronic literature:** The birth of E lit came about a similar time that technology did, interestingly though it would be considered as digital oriented literature, not to be confused with digitalized print literature.

**Quote:** (While the E lit definition is still contested to this day, below are other definitions that my own has take inspiration from.) “works with important literary aspects that take advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer” (“What is E-lit?”);[2] and Scott Rettberg’s recent definition, “electronic literature is most simply described as new forms and genres of writing that explore the specific capabilities of the computer and network – literature that would not be possible without the contemporary digital context”(2019: 2).

An interesting concept brought up briefly was how vast E lit is. One story on the internet can be seen by indviduals around the world that one physical literature book might not be able to do. Does that mean that E lit could be considered a mor community/social based craft, then an accolade type of work? I would have to say yes.

**Brief History -** 

**Quote:** For many years, the electronic literature community has considered “Stochastic Texts” (1959) by Theo Lutz as the first digital literary text.[4] German scholar, philosopher, and poet Max Bense suggested that Lutz use a random generator to accidentally determine texts. Bense looked to establish a scientific and objective branch of aesthetics, by means of applying mathematical and information theoretical premises to the study of aesthetic texts.

**Europe -** 

**Quote:** Portugal also has an interesting tradition of experimenting with literature, especially as far as automatic, generative, combinatory texts are concerned. The Portuguese writer and poet Ernesto Manuel de Melo e Castro is considered the father of the so-called “videopoetry” in which animation and temporality are brought to poetry and that then largely influence digital poetry. According to him “videopoetry” was “inevitable as a concept” answering the challenge of the new technological means for producing texts and images (de Melo e Castro 2007). 

It is interesting to consider a place like Portugal as having something worthwhile to show in terms of digital literature, but much like the internet that allows anyone access, a work many find invigorating will be quick to take off.

**North America -** To look at electronic literature as a “mode of practice,” each work of e-lit would then be differentiated from another based upon which tools are utilized in making it. In this way, we believe it is best to begin this account of the origins of North American electronic literature with the first programs and platforms that were utilized to create e-lit and the genres that they inspired.

North America takes a much more concrete approach to E lit, instead of the more fanciful parts it instead has attempted to categorise the types of e lit into the tools that are used. An important way of defining what is game and what is literature, if not a little inaccurate as we are still finding out today. It has also allowed for such terminology like hypertext to be formed, a term use quite frequently and in my own work.

**Quote:** Throughout Canadian electronic literature the visual concerns of transmedial and born-digital projects are heavily indebted to concrete poetry, as interpreted by earlier Canadian practitioners like bpNichol and Steve McCaffery. Nichol already saw the poetic potentials of the digital in his own work, extending the formal and visual concerns of his typewriter-based concrete poetry into digital technologies in 1982 

**Latin America -** According to Thea Pitman, some of the very earliest works, though notably quite technically advanced for their time of creation, are the autobiographical hypermedia projects Sangre Boliviana [Bolivian Blood] (1994) by Latina artist Lucia Grossberger Morales (Bolivia), and Glasshouses: A Tour of American Assimilation from a Mexican-American Perspective (1997) by Chicana artist Jacalyn López García (Mexico-USA). Both works explore the feeling of belonging to two or more cultures and expressing it with the digital tools of the time. 

While not as developed as Europe and North America the types of works being done were considered at the time to be highly advanced. More interestingly they used quite a bit of hypertext.

**Arab digital literature -** The emergence of the pioneering works in the field of visual digital poetry is attributed to the Moroccan poet Mun’im al-Azraq, who published a large number of digital poems on al-Mirsa’ website, in which he combined media with colors, pictures, photos, paintings, and music. 

For most of these places, poetry seemed to be the leading type of writing which was the base form used to get into E lit. I wonder if the nature of poetry - whimsical, nonsensical at times of still holding to traditional values - is what allowed it to fit into such a broad box that is E lit without having to forgo its natural literature troupes.


**From Romantic to post humanist authorship:**

Questions I have:
Are you an author without the academia accolade? Does authorship matter in E lit, or is the sharing of ideas to be valued more?

Is E lit altering how we respect our work, and if so is E lit destroying literature? 

Our world runs on achievements, as well as funding we give as students or benefactors to universities. We learn skills and then translate those skills over to our job, which if in the writing field requires a physical copy to show of ones skills, if "Authorial productivity and, connected to this, the originality of one’s work are important factors in determining a scholar’s standing within academic value networks," where does the continual flow of never-ending e lit stories fit into that. Should be base it off viewership much like one would the success of a print book? Or should it be quality of what you use to make the product, but how would you work out which coding practice is better than the other?

**Quote:** This fetishization of scholarly authorship is integral to an increasingly hegemonic academic discourse related to originality and authority, to impact and responsibility, and linked to a humanist and romantic notion of the individual author-genius. 

It is interesting that now looking at literature, I can acknowledge how selfish it is, how one dimension writing has become, I don’t think it means it is bad however just something which makes E lit an obvious outsider.

**Quote:** Although we have been proclaiming the “death of the author” for over half a century now, humanist authorship remains strongly embedded within our institutions and cultural practices. As such, I examine various practical experiments with authorship critique in different fields and contexts in what follows, including hypertext, which can be seen to focus mainly on replacing the authority and responsibility of the author with that of the reader. 

Is the concept of 'death of the author' more metaphorical - I understand its not literal, but rather is it the idea that we no longer are separating the iconic 'narrative distance' literature has created and thus 'killing' the author and turning them into just a viewer with a bit more creative license? 

**Quote:** The text and the book are reconnected with their author and her or his intentions, yet these intentions are no longer seen as fully determining the meaning of a text, nor its reception. In this vision, authorship is fragmented, dispersed, and plays a more contingent role.
