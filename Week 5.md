### **Hypertext fiction Print Precursors examples and my opinions on them:**

**Marc Saporta, Composition No. 1 (1961)**

A: Marc Saporta’s Composition No. 1 (1962) is a ground breaking work of experimental fiction. Instead of following the traditional method of a bound format, it instead has around 150 unbound pages placed in a box, with each page containing a vignette. This type of literary experimentation allows readers to make a decision of the order in which to read them creating a unique narrative experience. It might contain the same themes and words but it is clear that the reading of it and the emotional response can vary depending on which order it is read in.

The  synopsis of the novel states that the story is centred around a group of Parisians during world war 2. told in fragmented pieces the reader must piece these narrative threads together. But due to how it is written the story is dependent on how the reader shapes it. 

The story challenges customary storytelling with its non linear structure and by creating autonomy on the reader's part in assembling the narrative. Each page is a snapshot of a moment or character, and the lack of a chronological order opens up room for readers to engage and personalize the reading experience.

**Vladimir Nabokov, Pale Fire (1962)**

A: Pale Fire (1962) by Vladimir Nabokov while it isn't an interactive fiction piece in the normal sense does contain similar structures and complexes which make it something of its own. The work described as an unconventional novel that blends poetry, fiction, and literary criticism into a complex and metafictional work, utilises poor narration and a non linear structure to make for a more engaging piece. It forces the readers to try and understand the interpretation which means a less passive read.  

_Does that mean that narration is key to interactive fiction - so a poor narrator means more interactivity?_ 

Pale Fire is a work that reflects the 999 line poem with the same title by the fictional poet John Shade followed by commentary written on the side by Charles Kinbote. The story includes detailed contemplations on death and the what comes after, it strives to makes sense and show clarity on the anguish of Kinbote's madness as well as the tragic story of Shade's unattractive and lonely daughter. 

The Author plays with this idea of authorial control, and gives a sort of madness to the piece when it comes to who should 'own' the text. The author of the book, the fictional poet or the commentor.


**Julio Cortázar, Hopscotch (1963)**

Hopscotch by Julio Cortazar is often considered a proto-hypertext, while not computerised it does follow rather similar conventions. The narrative revolves around our lead Horacio Oliveira, the first chapter up to 56 follow like a conventional novel after that the reader has a chance to choose how to continue the story. He is an Argentine intellectual living between Paris and Buenos Aires, whose life aims to answer existential questions and the meaning of life.

_Multiple Reading Paths:_

Hopscotch gives a Table of Instructions at the beginning which give two primary ways to read it. The first is the more traditional linear reading of the initial chapters, while the second requires a non-linear approach incorporates later chapters. This means the reader can experience and potentially uncover different aspects of the story. 

_Expendable Chapters:_

The novel also has "expendable chapters" which while appearing random can be sued to solve quandaries found in the main story. A bit more personal and a lot more interactive These chapters mean readers have the choice to delve into these sections or ignore them, impacting their overall understanding of the story. 



**BS Johnson, The Unfortunates (1969)**

A: Whilst quite similar to Pale fire in terms of format - both use the concept of a box filled with unbound chapters, for BS only the first and last chapter are numbered the rest can be read however - BS Johnson chooses to show his differences in the context, whilst pale fire focused heavily of death and grief and the essence of literary creation and reception, Unfortunates, explores themes of power, societal structures, and individual agency.  It reinforces the idea of truth as something inherently messy and sometimes quite ugly.



**Choose Your Own Adventure (1979–1998)**

A: The Choose Your Own Adventure series is a second person narrative which uses interactive gameplay such as branching storylines - normally as page numbers to follow - to make readers the protagonists of their own stories. At certain points it will give choices to how the continuation of the story can go - e.g., "If you go left, turn to page 10. If you go right, turn to page 30.)
More interestingly however is how reflective of dungeons and dragons it is, not just in the types of themes and range of genres, but how the readers actions can lead to success or failure, much like a real game would have, it truly does put emphasis on exploration as the key takeaway from this story.




#### Readings

### **No Sense of an Ending: Hypertext Aesthetics:**

_Ergodic Literature is defined as:_ texts where "nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text" (Aarseth, 1997). This effort can include various forms of interaction, such as navigating through hypertext, deciphering puzzles, or following unconventional narrative structures.

Similar to some of the previous readings in terms of authorship, and makes a reading successful. Aarseth sees Ergodic literature as something more than just reading - it requires a level of participation and interactivity that nonergodic literature simply cannot compute - literally and metaphorically. 

Hypertext in this format is considered a medium in which to display information - it is a system, not just a writing tool. Like with paper books and the action of turning the page to get to the next chapter, Hypertext utilises computer space - holding spots - to jump from one key point in the story to another, the only difference being the tool in which the book is found and how the information is presented. 

Once again, we come back to the idea of authorship; however, when the story we write requires an outside source for the story to progress. I would argue that a paper book is trapped in the same boat as it still requires a level of interaction to achieve its ends result, which is for the reader to read it. Unfortunately, however, the point of authorship seems to come down to choice. A literary text demands nothing but the reader's attention, whilst hypertext places a significant amount of power into the viewer's hands and challenges the idea of authorship, for if the ending is not guaranteed and can be shaped by external factors, is it truly the author's story anymore?

Aaseth would argue that the topical restraints we place around hypertext allow us to still retain a level of control and authority otherwise diminished by a paper book.

Nelson claims otherwise and argues that hypertext was merely a means to sort information clearly and can be identified as a means to make reading and writing come together in a single process. (Aaseth 1997)

So is it a new way of reading and writing, or is it just how the viewer identifies with it that alters how we respond to it? If so, then works like Apollinaire's calligrams and the I Ching, which require active participation, would also be considered ergodic literature. So maybe then hypertext can just be considered a medium used by writers, not a new form of writing.


**Questions**

**What do you think of Aarseth's concept?** 

A: I believe that Aarseth seeks to define writing and reading as something more than the limitations we have put on them. When I consider Aarseth's opinion, I am separating my thoughts, which have a rigid understanding of writing, including authorship and reader involvement, to accept the involvement of hypertext as something more than just computer-based. I believe many people have a fear of AI and its hand in our future. Aarseth seems to accept it and seeks to make the reader more aware of the literary propaganda that we fall under. 

**Explain how it offers an alternative to conventional ideas of narrative and the role of the reader and writer.** 

A: I might have already stated this, but writing shouldn’t be considered as one form. If we can have a multitude of genres, it makes sense that the platforms and mediums we use to present and share this work would also be many. The conventional forms of narrative dictate one set of rules as the correct way to write a story, publish a story and read a story. The unfortunate case for many is that such a thing is often impractical, and I believe it diminishes both the author's role in the creation and the reader's job. Ergodic literature opens up possibilities. And while some could say it is an unfair balance, its job is to break down conditioned stereotypes and into the world of computerised magic, whilst not all future forms will be internet-based, we are currently following certain trends which see most humans using some of the technology. The online forums prioritise interactivity, so why shouldn’t writing also be inclusive of this?





### **Hypertext Fiction Ever After:**

Stuart begins this essay by discussing the genealogy of hypertext. Or rather, he begins a breakdown of ways in which it could be done. It doesn’t seem clear just where it starts, however, it is interesting to discuss the types of platforms utilised in the past. Some of these early works used such mediums as Storyspace, a software platform that allows for nonlinear storytelling through interconnected text blocks. It is curious how hypertext has changed over time and if this has at all impacted the writing done alongside it. 

Stuart argues that the growth of technology has meant a transition in how hypertext is used. Whilst we have lost certain mediums to share stories, the revitalisation of hypertext into a more general position has meant we have seen a growth in new mediums being born to accommodate this transition has improved hypertext's functions and its involvement in written texts.

Similar to Aaseth's discussion, Stuart seeks to understand where authorship fits into this system of hypertext. Not only that, but how such a thing as twine has meant hypertext can never be completely destroyed, although some would argue that twine isn't the same but rather an evolved application of it. Similar to how video games have developed, we can see that Twine takes on elements of both the hypertext formats and the more interactive choose-your-own-story formats that come with such games. 


### **Deleuze reframed: a guide for the arts student:** 

A: aims to target westernised thinking - they compared it to one tree, one truth. Called it binary thinking. I believe that the terminology of binary thinking was to acknowledge that one voice does not mean one opinion. 
Rhizome thinking was not created to be in opposition to Western thinking, as to do so would make it another binary opposition and would imply that one way of thinking was better than the other, which is exactly what Westernised thinking was doing.
The Rhizome has no beginning or end but rather a middle which can overflow. This is a great way of describing ergodic literature as well as the case of most hypertext fiction.  

**Deterritorialization/ reterritorialization** 

Rhizome can create change, and Deterritorialization refers to the change in which the rhizome creates, whilst reterritorialization refers to the result of such change. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8e4c0f7-519b-4741-9c91-02c924d15d38)


I would like to say that with every change there is a concurring response - or another way of seeing it is that, like with writing, it is an assemblage of multiple parts, and each time we take from the original, a new part is formed with old links to the original.

**Regarding our discussion about new terms and concepts for thinking beyond binaries: author/reader text/audience ficion/fact etc, and genres or 'silos': novel, poetry, essay, memoir, literature, art, game etc
How could you plan hypertext fiction?**

These frameworks challenge essentialist categories and invite more fluid, participatory, and emergent forms of storytelling, such as hypertext fiction.


**Assemblage** (Deleuze & Guattari)
→ Moves away from fixed identities (e.g., "author") to a network of relations. Texts are dynamic constellations of parts.

**Rhizome** (also Deleuze & Guattari)
→ Non-hierarchical, non-linear structure—just like hypertext. Think of texts that branch, re-branch, and connect in surprising ways.

**Other external terms that are separate from the binary terms that I have come across.**

**Transmedia**

→ Storytelling that spans multiple platforms - employs a collection of complementary elements such a video, text, photos and games that can be experienced in a variety of forms and contexts.

**Post-textuality**

→ The idea that "the text" is not central, but instead finds the greatest amount of success in reflection.

**Reader-as-Co-Creator**

→ Emphasises reader agency in shaping the meaning or even the path of the narrative. Interactivity is core here.

**Fictioning (Simon O'Sullivan)**

→ Blurs fiction and fact and utilises acts of writing and visual elements to enact and propose worlds or social systems that diverge from dominant institutions of life. 

**Ludonarrative**

→addresses the relationship between the gaming mechanics and narrative principles of general literature. This term is trying to connect the two.

**Autoethnographic Fiction**

→ seeks to understand the relationship of the author's lived experience, and seeks to connect the personal with the academic- it moves beyond "fact/fiction" as binary opposites.

**Genre Hybridity / Postgenre Writing**

→ purposefully mixes genres to subvert literary conventions. It could be poetic games, narrative essays. 

**Affect Theory**

→ seeks to understand the text as an emotional response rather than just critically analysing what it means.



**How could you plan hypertext fiction?**

A: There are a few ways I could do this - I like the idea of hypertext but in a literary form, a bit like Pale Fire. I think it is a plausible method of creating a physical copy of hypertext.

**"In what sense can a hypertext be a narrative?**

A: I would say that hypertext is a tool that can be used to narrate a story rather than a purely narrative one. In a sense, hypertext can direct a story and be the control behind which way a story goes, but I wouldn't refer to it as narrative as it doesn't write the story. I would argue that the narrator is what guides the reader and thus the story, which means that while hypertext is just a tool, it can have narrative elements.


**Is hypertext a literary genre or a literary technique?"**

A: Like the question above, I believe it is plausible to argue that it can be both. But, for the sake of this question, I would have to say that hypertext is a literary technique, simply because it is mainly used to enhance features already present in a text or to make the written word poetic, prose or just generally more interactively appealing to the viewer/reader. More so, Hypertext fiction is a subset of electronic literature — “work with an important literary aspect that takes advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer." () while hypertext, as we have discussed elsewhere, can be external of the internet i would still argue that it is a simple tool not a literary genre.

**Tools to plan out my work/ what works, what doesn't**
A:
Miro: I have had a lot of success with Miro, the tool itself allows me to integrate both visuals and the beginnings of ideas. I have just set up a new page and will start to plan out my idea for my final assignment.

Padlet: I have used Padlet before, and while I like the function and accessibility of it, I find the system finicky and not as clean as Miro. 

Scrivener: I didn't mind the setup for this as it was a lot more clean cut and easier to use, however moving and planning what I wanted was harder and not as easy, I think in future if I wanted to plan out anoything i would need a tool which encomapsed both accesibilty and more interactivty.

Notes: This is just a tool to process thoughts and not really a way for me to clean plan out my story.



### **Toward Assessment 2**

Proposal discussion and reflections in folio:

The ma

Types of Prototypes I am considering: 

**Prototype 1:** Interactive Fiction Story

**Description:**

A branching narrative where the user plays as a detective solving a mystery. Each choice influences the story’s direction and ending.

**Common Issues & Troubleshooting:**

Broken Links (Red Passage Links)
Issue: When you click a link and it leads nowhere.
Cause: The passage it links to does not exist or has a typo.
Fix: Double-check spelling and capitalization of passage names. Use Twine’s “Passage Map” view to spot unconnected nodes.
Unclear Story Flow
Issue: Readers lose track of the plot or get confused by too many branches.
Fix: Use variables to control story flow. Add a variable like $clueFound and set it when the player discovers key evidence, guiding them back to the main plot.
Debugging Variables
Issue: Conditions don’t work as expected (e.g., the story says you found the clue when you didn’t).
Fix: Use the built-in debug mode (Story > Test Play) and the browser console to print variable values using <<print $clueFound>>.

**Prototype 2:** Educational Quiz Game

**Description:**

A multiple-choice quiz where players receive immediate feedback and scores at the end.

**Common Issues & Troubleshooting:**

Score Not Updating
Issue: The $score variable doesn’t increment.
Cause: Incorrect syntax (e.g., set $score =+ 1 instead of +=).
Fix: Use correct Harlowe or SugarCube syntax (e.g., <<set $score += 1>> for SugarCube). Always check documentation for syntax.
Answer Feedback Display Problems
Issue: Clicking an answer doesn’t show whether it’s right or wrong.
Fix: Use <<if>> statements to conditionally show feedback, and test each path. Consider showing feedback on the same passage to reduce errors from navigation.
Persistent Scores Between Tries
Issue: When replaying, old scores persist.
Fix: Reset variables at the start of the story (<<set $score to 0>>). Consider adding a "Reset Quiz" button that reloads the game.
Prototype 3: Dialogue-Based RPG Mini Game
Description:

The player interacts with different characters, building relationships based on conversation choices.

**Common Issues & Troubleshooting:**

Branch Overload
Issue: Complex dialogue trees are hard to manage.
Fix: Modularize conversations. Keep each major dialogue in its own passage or passage cluster. Use conditionals (<<if $friendshipLevel is 2>>) to manage dynamic responses instead of duplicating content.
Relationship Variables Not Saving
Issue: Choices don’t impact relationships.
Fix: Use clear and consistent variable names ($alexTrust, $sarahMood). Track changes carefully and test using Twine’s variable viewer or by outputting values on screen (<<print $alexTrust>>).
Player Choices Looping Incorrectly
Issue: Repetitive options keep reappearing.
Fix: Use flags to mark visited options (<<set $talkedToAlex to true>>) and use <<if not $talkedToAlex>> to hide options after they're used.

**Prototype 4:** Mental Health Self-Help Interactive Tool

**Description:**

A reflective journaling experience where users select prompts and receive affirmations and coping strategies based on their mood.

**Common Issues & Troubleshooting:**

Tone Mismatch or Repetitiveness
Issue: Reused affirmations or responses feel robotic or inappropriate.
Fix: Create multiple variations of supportive messages and randomize them using arrays (in SugarCube: <<set _affirmations = ["You're doing great.", "Take a deep breath.", "This moment will pass."]>> <<print _affirmations.random()>>).
Navigation Confusion
Issue: Users get lost in the interface.
Fix: Add a home button or a persistent sidebar with clear links back to main areas. Use consistent UI/UX patterns.
Privacy Concerns with Input
Issue: If users type responses, how is that data handled?
Fix: Clearly state that no data is stored (unless the tool is published online with backend storage). Avoid sensitive prompts if unsure about data privacy.



What is emerging for you in terms of your own piece toward Assessment 2 and 3:

I have decided to use twine instead of scroll animation.

What platform and technology does it require?

Do you know already if you can make it?

What else do you need to learn in order to execute your vision for this piece?

map your thoughts any way you like - use miro, use a corkboard, a table in a word doc, ppowerpoint, post it notes, whatever. If you use a physical medium take photos and pop them in a sharefolder linked to your Github folio.
