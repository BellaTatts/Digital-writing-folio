Hypertext fiction: concepts, precursors, critical framing. Below are some links and references to assist your thinking and understanding of hypertext. As we have learned, hypertext was one of the first innovations in E-Literature and remains an important aspect of this diverse field.

Print Precursors:

Marc Saporta, Composition No. 1 (1961)
Vladimir Nabokov, Pale Fire (1962)
Julio Cortázar, Hopscotch (1963)
BS Johnson, The Unfortunates (1969)
Choose Your Own Adventure (1979–1998)


This week's Required Reading (Aarseth 1997) unpacks some territory that speak directly to some of the great questions raised in your Case Study presnetations such as "in what sense can a hypertext be a narrative? Is hypertext a literary genre or a literary technique?" It introduces the important concept of "ergotics": "hypertext is not a reconfiguration of narrative but offers an alternative to it, as I try to demonstrate through the concept of ergodics." (p.95)

What do you think of Aarseth's concept? explain how it offer an alternative to conventional ideas of narrative and the role of reader and writer?
Regarding our discussion about new terms and concents for thinking beyond binaries: author/reader text/audience ficion/fact etc, and genres or 'silos': novel, poetry, essay, memoir, literature, art, game etc
