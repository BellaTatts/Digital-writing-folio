### **No Sense of an Ending: Hypertext Aesthetics:**

_Ergodic Literature is defined as:_ texts where "nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text" (Aarseth, 1997). This effort can include various forms of interaction, such as navigating through hypertext, deciphering puzzles, or following unconventional narrative structures.

Similar to some of the previous readings in terms of authorship, and makes a reading successful. Aarseth sees Ergodic literature as something more than just reading - it requires a level of participation and interactivity that nonergodic literature simply cannot compute - literally and metaphorically. 

Hypertext in this format is considered a medium in which to display information - it is a system, not just a writing tool. Like with paper books and the action of turning the page to get to the next chapter, Hypertext utilises computer space - holding spots - to jump from one key point in the story to another, the only difference being the tool in which the book is found and how the information is presented. 

Once again, we come back to the idea of authorship; however, when the story we write requires an outside source for the story to progress. I would argue that a paper book is trapped in the same boat as it still requires a level of interaction to achieve its ends result, which is for the reader to read it. Unfortunately, however, the point of authorship seems to come down to choice. A literary text demands nothing but the reader's attention, whilst hypertext places a significant amount of power into the viewer's hands and challenges the idea of authorship, for if the ending is not guaranteed and can be shaped by external factors, is it truly the author's story anymore?

Aaseth would argue that the topical restraints we place around hypertext allow us to still retain a level of control and authority otherwise diminished by a paper book.

Nelson claims otherwise and argues that hypertext was merely a means to sort information clearly and can be identified as a means to make reading and writing come together in a single process. (Aaseth 1997)

So is it a new way of reading and writing, or is it just how the viewer identifies with it that alters how we respond to it? If so, then works like Apollinaire's calligrams and the I Ching, which require active participation, would also be considered ergodic literature. So maybe then hypertext can just be considered a medium used by writers, not a new form of writing.


**Questions**

**What do you think of Aarseth's concept?** 

A: I believe that Aarseth seeks to define writing and reading as something more than the limitations we have put on them. When I consider Aarseth's opinion, I am separating my thoughts, which have a rigid understanding of writing, including authorship and reader involvement, to accept the involvement of hypertext as something more than just computer-based. I believe many people have a fear of AI and its hand in our future. Aarseth seems to accept it and seeks to make the reader more aware of the literary propaganda that we fall under. 

**Explain how it offers an alternative to conventional ideas of narrative and the role of the reader and writer.** 

A: I might have already stated this, but writing shouldn’t be considered as one form. If we can have a multitude of genres, it makes sense that the platforms and mediums we use to present and share this work would also be many. The conventional forms of narrative dictate one set of rules as the correct way to write a story, publish a story and read a story. The unfortunate case for many is that such a thing is often impractical, and I believe it diminishes both the author's role in the creation and the reader's job. Ergodic literature opens up possibilities. And while some could say it is an unfair balance, its job is to break down conditioned stereotypes and into the world of computerised magic, whilst not all future forms will be internet-based, we are currently following certain trends which see most humans using some of the technology. The online forums prioritise interactivity, so why shouldn’t writing also be inclusive of this?





### **Hypertext Fiction Ever After:**

Stuart begins this essay by discussing the genealogy of hypertext. Or rather, he begins a breakdown of ways in which it could be done. It doesn’t seem clear just where it starts, however, it is interesting to discuss the types of platforms utilised in the past. Some of these early works used such mediums as Storyspace, a software platform that allows for nonlinear storytelling through interconnected text blocks. It is curious how hypertext has changed over time and if this has at all impacted the writing done alongside it. 

Stuart argues that the growth of technology has meant a transition in how hypertext is used. Whilst we have lost certain mediums to share stories, the revitalisation of hypertext into a more general position has meant we have seen a growth in new mediums being born to accommodate this transition has improved hypertext's functions and its involvement in written texts.

Similar to Aaseth's discussion, Stuart seeks to understand where authorship fits into this system of hypertext. Not only that, but how such a thing as twine has meant hypertext can never be completely destroyed, although some would argue that twine isn't the same but rather an evolved application of it. Similar to how video games have developed, we can see that Twine takes on elements of both the hypertext formats and the more interactive choose-your-own-story formats that come with such games. 


### **Deleuze reframed: a guide for the arts student:** 

A: aims to target westernised thinking - they compared it to one tree, one truth. Called it binary thinking. I believe that the terminology of binary thinking was to acknowledge that one voice does not mean one opinion. 
Rhizome thinking was not created to be in opposition to Western thinking, as to do so would make it another binary opposition and would imply that one way of thinking was better than the other, which is exactly what Westernised thinking was doing.
The Rhizome has no beginning or end but rather a middle which can overflow. This is a great way of describing ergodic literature as well as the case of most hypertext fiction.  

**Deterritorialization/ reterritorialization** 

Rhizome can create change, and Deterritorialization refers to the change in which the rhizome creates, whilst reterritorialization refers to the result of such change.

I would like to say that with every change there is a concurring response - or another way of seeing it is that, like with writing, it is an assemblage of multiple parts, and each time we take from the original, a new part is formed with old links to the original.

**Regarding our discussion about new terms and concepts for thinking beyond binaries: author/reader text/audience ficion/fact etc, and genres or 'silos': novel, poetry, essay, memoir, literature, art, game etc
How could you plan hypertext fiction?**

These frameworks challenge essentialist categories and invite more fluid, participatory, and emergent forms of storytelling, such as hypertext fiction.


**Assemblage** (Deleuze & Guattari)
→ Moves away from fixed identities (e.g., "author") to a network of relations. Texts are dynamic constellations of parts.

**Rhizome** (also Deleuze & Guattari)
→ Non-hierarchical, non-linear structure—just like hypertext. Think of texts that branch, re-branch, and connect in surprising ways.

**Other external terms that are separate from the binary terms that I have come across.**

**Transmedia**

→ Storytelling that spans multiple platforms - employs a collection of complementary elements such a video, text, photos and games that can be experienced in a variety of forms and contexts.

**Post-textuality**

→ The idea that "the text" is not central, but instead finds the greatest amount of success in reflection.

**Reader-as-Co-Creator**

→ Emphasises reader agency in shaping the meaning or even the path of the narrative. Interactivity is core here.

**Fictioning (Simon O'Sullivan)**

→ Blurs fiction and fact and utilises acts of writing and visual elements to enact and propose worlds or social systems that diverge from dominant institutions of life. 

**Ludonarrative**

→addresses the relationship between the gaming mechanics and narrative principles of general literature. This term is trying to connect the two.

**Autoethnographic Fiction**

→ seeks to understand the relationship of the author's lived experience, and seeks to connect the personal with the academic- it moves beyond "fact/fiction" as binary opposites.

**Genre Hybridity / Postgenre Writing**

→ purposefully mixes genres to subvert literary conventions. It could be poetic games, narrative essays. 

**Affect Theory**

→ seeks to understand the text as an emotional response rather than just critically analysing what it means.
