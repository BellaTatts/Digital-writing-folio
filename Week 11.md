Publishing Electronic Literature: 

James O’Sullivan’s essay examines the challenges and considerations involved in publishing electronic literature (e-lit). James draws from his extensive experience as the founding editor of New Binary Press, O’Sullivan to provide key insights into the often difficult nature of E lit and trying to bring digital literary works to the public.

He discusses the financial restraints faced by indecent publishers, he discusses the technological restraints as well as the cultural constraints.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcf03444-b040-4b1c-a559-7cdee015324f)
