Today we will spend the first hour of class troubleshooting tech issues. If you are using Twine and have not embedded images yet, test this out asap. People commonly have directory issues that need to be worked through.

Also make sure your project is published using GitHub Pages as this is how Lucinda and Jenny will view your project during marking. Test that it looks/plays as expected.

Please remember that Jenny is available for tech support through Week 12 (next week) only and the last class is Wednesday 28th May. Jenny will attend this Wednesday 28th class to provide last-minute tech support and will wrap up with the evening drop-in session from 5.25-6.25pm. Jenny cannot guarantee availability to offer tech support on the 29th/30th due to full-time study so get in early. Email your problems/screenshot issues so that they sit in our inboxes and we will get to them as soon as time permits.

Today we will walk over to 8.4.13 together for the Horizons showcase which runs from 3.30–5pm.

Wednesday class – 21st May

Today is a working session on both your final pieces and folios. In class Lucinda will be consulting on folio development and the structural and literary elements of your pieces. If you wish to work from home Lucinda can provide feedback through a screengrab video - please email any questions. It's important at this stage that your developing works are published through Gihhub pages or at least that the code is pushed to a repo on Github so we can view the work. We'll be checking this over the next week to make sure everyone is on track on this point and no one has a panic on the day of submission because they can't publish. Remember both Lucinda and Jenny will be overseas in week 13 and not immedately contactable. In class today we will also troubleshoot common problems. We are finding that people are coming up against a lot of the same issues. Jenny has added these solutions to the Twine Resources page.
