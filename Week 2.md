**Digital poesis impulse: A methodology of creative coding with GPT as co-pilot:** 

We already have firm rules in place about where AI can be used and how it can be used, but when we consider the principles of Digital writing including the use of coding where does such rules apply. And could we consider works made entirely by AI a type of E lit or does it have to have a human element?

**Quote:** In my poetic practice, I take inspiration from affective responses to nature, relationality or archives. Sometimes thoughts pour out of me so fast I can only capture them in fragments in my journal; I transcribe these snippets with a word processor, editing and refining until I end up with something that is a poem because I say it is. 

So if you write the words, and all you do is put it through a medium which orders them to be cohesive like Chat GPT then does that count as a literary work? Something else worth mentioning is the position of poems in the world of writing. For many I'm sure we've seen a poem that exceeds the limits of poetry all because the author has declared it to be so. So if we can argue for that then could we not do the same for the involvement of AI, which is just another form of innovation?

**Quote:** Winnicott argues that without methodical meaning-making, rigidly adhering to actual reality leads to “a sense of futility for the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters, and life is not worth living” (p. 87). The digital playground allows me to slough off the rules of external reality: within technological limits, any textual thing I can imagine, I can aim to create. 

If that is the case, then are we getting lazy with our practise and turning to things like digital playgrounds in order to compensate. Or maybe it is an attempt at removing oneself from the rigid societal codes by falling into another type of coding, one that makes the traditional writing redundant. 

_Are poems just data points?_

**Quote:** As a way of filtering unruly sets of information, a poet-programmer can group data into arrays set to populate specified text areas. 

**Quote:** most coders no longer write from scratch. Markup, stylesheet and programming languages and their libraries, such as those I have mentioned, are inherently open standard or open source [1]. 

_Is there an art form in coding? 
Is substantially changing how we code and making it easier for others to use, creating problems in the E lit industry? Are we putting too much emphasis of the visual elements rather than the written component?_



**Enlightening Interactive Fiction : Andrew Plotkin’s Shade:** 

Shade takes interactive to a whole new level. While changing one word can affect the plot line, having to guess a sentence structure or key word in relation to a topic makes both the reader (would they still be called that if they are now a part of the story?) and the work in question ever more present. 

If I choose this world a correlating action will occur, neither positive or negative, just an everyday action for an everyday problem.

**Quote:** Rather than YOU being the main character, you had the opportunity to role-play the main character, exploring "your" personality as a detective, a spy, an AI, etc., even while exploring the environment . . . and there were many "you" roles to explore.

**Quote:** For the player, the psychological error messages naturalize the limits of the simulation as merely the limits of a personality. Rather than being disciplined for attempting to explore the unimplemented reaches of the world, the player is invited to discover the inhibitions (and thus definitions) of a persona.

_Is this a valid interactive work?  Allowing the viewer to naturally discover the story through actions rather than just words? _

**Kissing the Steak: The Poetry of Text Generators:**

The coding is formulaic, you can introduce a multitude of words and each would bring out a new version of the same words. And yet even this form of repetition while through an algorithm can be considered poetic or a form of poetic logic, especially when read as a whole.

**Quote:** Repetition— a strong indicator of some sort of permutation— is as blatant a characteristic of the output text here as it is in many early works of computer poetry. 

The work while slightly difficult to understand infers that the coding practise allows for a new form of internal thought, on which depending on how the poem is set can influence how the viewer interacts with piece. I wonder if it is meant to replicate the response we have when pulling apart a poem and dissecting is metaphorical innards for its meaning. I wonder if the same pleasure applies to works that must first be coded into existence, is like knowing what the words mean separately but then being forced to work out how they fit in a sentence alongside others.

**Quote:** Slots A creative programmer can impose outside (artificial) order and formal structure in computer poems by designing a framework where only certain components are randomly filled by grammatically appropriate words.

Include coding excerises here, start planning case study due in week 4
