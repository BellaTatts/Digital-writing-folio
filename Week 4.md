#### Practical assignment 

Looked at Scroll animation for the speech and investigated whether or not I wanted to include it in my own work.


Last week when we deployed our coding playgrounds using GitHub pages we ran into errors. Jenny has thoroughly investigated this and the issue is related to certain JavaScript functionality around "event listeners", which we use frequently in digital poetics but which in real world (aka capitalism and the vectors of communication run by tech oligarchs) carry the potential for security risks. Our poems, however, pose no security risks to us, and so the way to get around this will be to create an account with Vercel using your GitHub credentials. Other options for free website deployment include Render and Netlify. Jenny will demonstrate in class how to then deploy your coding playground website through Vercel. Knowing how to do this will make life easy later, when it comes time to publish our Twine stories and websites.

my resposne to using twine


Today we will focus on learning Twine, a user-friendly platform for writing interactive fiction. Jenny will begin with a 1990s example of pioneering hypertext fiction before sharing contemporary examples of Twine stories published in literary journals, and Lucinda will follow up in the Wednesday class with student examples so you'll have an idea of the level of work you might be expected to produce.

looked at 1990s hypertext example called my body.

looked at twine and what it is.
