I haven't had any issues with deploying the coding playground, however, I made a note to utilise Vercel in case of any issues.

my resposne to using twine


Today we will focus on learning Twine, a user-friendly platform for writing interactive fiction. Jenny will begin with a 1990s example of pioneering hypertext fiction before sharing contemporary examples of Twine stories published in literary journals, and Lucinda will follow up in the Wednesday class with student examples so you'll have an idea of the level of work you might be expected to produce.

Key terms in Twine - 
CSS (Cascading style sheets): is programming language for describing the presentation of HTML elements (i.e. the colors, fonts, spacing, and general layout of a web page). When using Twine, additional CSS rules can be added through the Story Stylesheet screen. This CSS is inserted into the final story and provides an opportunity to override the color and formatting choices expressed in the story format's own stylesheet.

There are three primary forms of selectors in CSS:

### type: 
These select different elements like <p> or <div>. They are written using the form of p {} or div {}.
### class: 
These select elements based on their class attribute. They are written using the form .className.
### id: 
These select elements based on their id attribute. They are written using the form #idName.

#### Practical assignment 

Looked at the Scroll animation for the speech and investigated whether or not I wanted to include it in my own work.

For a brief definition of scroll animation: "It is a common UX pattern on the web. These are animations that are linked to the scroll position of a scroll container. This means that as you scroll up or down, the linked animation scrubs forward or backward in direct response."
