#### Practical assignment 1 completed - 

Looked at the Scroll animation for the speech and investigated whether or not I wanted to include it in my own work.
Looked at the Vine and the fish.

#### Background info: 
For some background context, Hook is a cartoonist and illustrator based in Stockholm, Sweden. Her work has appeared in The Believer, The New Yorker. Typically, Hookâ€™s work seeks to represent emotional strains of everyday problems in the form of literary stories formatted as comic strips like the nest and Beijing bike. There is a reserved quality to her work that provides an interesting contrast to its inherent emotional content this flows onto the colour palate. The vine and the fish is no different, but instead of the classic comic it utilises a limited-animation down scrolling comic that compares the "invasive species" like the kudzu vine and the Asian carp to xenophobia and generalized anti-immigration sentiment that was fanned during the Trump administration.

#### Problems with Scroll animation: 
This type of animation is linked to the scroll position of a scroll container. This means that when you scroll up or down, the linked animation scrubs forward or backward in direct response, thus moving between images and text. One of the issues I found in Hooks' work and a problem across most creators using this form of animation is linking the images and text with the scroll motion. I found it rather easy to miss images and text if I were to scroll to fast. I also found that the inclusion of images and sound created extra 'noise.' So instead of just focusing on the message of the story, the animation was what had the most impact.

At the moment, I'm trying to create a GitHub website as doing such a thing will allow me to create the scroll animation effect. I'm using Visual Studio Code, but I am having problems with the website.

As each time I put it in, this comes up:

I haven't had any issues with deploying the coding playground, however, I made a note to utilise Vercel in case of any issues.

My response to using twine - Upon trying my hand at scroll animation, I attempted to do it through big brand names such as wix, but when I attempted the coding, it required further fees, which I will discuss down below: 


Today we will focus on learning Twine, a user-friendly platform for writing interactive fiction. Jenny will begin with a 1990s example of pioneering hypertext fiction before sharing contemporary examples of Twine stories published in literary journals, and Lucinda will follow up in the Wednesday class with student examples so you'll have an idea of the level of work you might be expected to produce.

Key terms in Twine - 
CSS (Cascading style sheets): is programming language for describing the presentation of HTML elements (i.e. the colors, fonts, spacing, and general layout of a web page). When using Twine, additional CSS rules can be added through the Story Stylesheet screen. This CSS is inserted into the final story and provides an opportunity to override the color and formatting choices expressed in the story format's own stylesheet.

There are three primary forms of selectors in CSS:

### type: 
These select different elements like <p> or <div>. They are written using the form of p {} or div {}.
### class: 
These select elements based on their class attribute. They are written using the form .className.
### id: 
These select elements based on their id attribute. They are written using the form #idName.

looked at 1990s hypertext example called my body.

looked at twine and what it is.
looked at how to chnage the story style sheet


#### Practical Assignment 2 planning

For a brief definition of scroll animation: "It is a common UX pattern on the web. These are animations that are linked to the scroll position of a scroll container. This means that as you scroll up or down, the linked animation scrubs forward or backward in direct response." 

Idea/Concept: A Futuristic look into AI in a world without life. I am looking at ideas of how I could fit the scroll animation into my work. Since I am considering looking at The Vine and the Fish as my example for assignment 1, I have been researching how to work with it with CSS. I am not quite confident with the overall coding part, but I have been looking at videos like down below to help translate some of the language. Although twine does have many good elements too that might actually fit better, if i want the story to b more interactive.
