# Week 3 

Looked at readings - Indistinguishable from Magic: Invisible Interfaces and Digital Literature as Demystifier and Beyond Taxonomy: Digital Poetics and the Problem of Reading

### reading 1 -  (Emerson, Lori. Reading Writing Interfaces: From the Digital to the Bookbound, University of Minnesota Press, 2014. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/rmit/detail.action?docID=1680083.)

"All of these interfaces share a common goal underlying their designs: to efface the interface altogether and so also efface our ability to read, let alone write, the interface, definitively turning us into consumers rather than producers of content." 

Technology by the way of umbicomp is the third wave of computing and is embedded in our everyday life rather than just on a computer screen. This form of technology is commonly referred to as ubiquitous computing, which uses more natural interfaces to interact with humans.

Mark believed umbicomp was the antidote to Windows and desktop computing now digital writing is being considered as the anitdote to the invisible nature of umbicomp.
