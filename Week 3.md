#### Readings



### Reading 1 - 

**Quote:** "All of these interfaces share a common goal underlying their designs: to efface the interface altogether and so also efface our ability to read, let alone write, the interface, definitively turning us into consumers rather than producers of content." 

Technology by the way of umbicomp is the third wave of computing and is embedded in our everyday life rather than just on a computer screen. This form of technology is commonly referred to as ubiquitous computing, which uses more natural interfaces to interact with humans.

Mark believed umbicomp was the antidote to Windows and desktop computing now digital writing is being considered as the anitdote to the invisible nature of umbicomp.

**Oulipian theory** - 

Is a set of literary constraints and techniques that explore the potential of language and literature through rigorous experimentation and formalized processes. 

Oulipian sought to use the literary legend that we as the sonnet to make a new combinatory form of poetry. 
It was interesting to understand the creative flow that used the forgotten sonnet and its traditional values and made it into something else - not entirely new but not old either.

The perception of writing back then was a wholly different artifice which prided not on the play elements or even the forced constraints to enhance a written work, but rather dismissed the topic as problematic and not worth the time of studying.

**Quote:** "Constraints are treated therein as aberrations, as pathological monstrosities of language and of writing; the works resulting from them are not even worthy to be called "works"

Its this idea that to exceed ones literary limits is to go down the path of madness. Perec believed such tactics were used to stunt innovation. Oulipian was a literary paradox, he both worked the traditionalist method while also delved into the experimental.

I wonder if the hesitance and sometimes downright refusal to accept change was due to more than just straying from the norm? Much like how we see mathematics involvement in writing as highly unusual - although practised much more when we consider the endless potential of coding - the pressure to conform to what worked and the fear of the 'what if' that creatively binds itself to any writer. 

**Quote:**
"But can an artificial structure be viable? Does it have the slightest chance to take root in the cultural tissue of a society and to produce leaf, flower, and fruit? Enthusiastic modernists are convinced of it; diehard traditionalists are persuaded of the contrary."

An interesting find was how people categorised the experimental and the traditional and how both utilised their own types of constraints, I believe Oulipian was aware of such a thing and thus was pushing to break from the Ancestors mould into something accepted. While Oulipian would argue that he was doing no such thing his work would say otherwise.


### Reading 2 - 

**Quote:** All of these interfaces share a common goal underlying their designs: to efface the interface altogether and so also efface our ability to read, let alone write, the interface, definitively turning us into consumers rather than producers of content.

Is coding the epicentre between literature and software? If we are to consider the current software as a true loss to digital making - now all we have is predetermined choices, then maybe E lit is important to tempering our consumptive natures by feeding our more creative outlets.  

But much like the fears from Oulipian's time we seem to have nothing but a constant flow of 'new.' New writing techniques, new writing types or variations of what was. Maybe this is our form of constraint, one that struggles to return to more traditional values is what the past writers feared - recluse when they were included forgotten when excluded. 


### Reading 3 - 

The concept of synergy to describe the relationship between poetry and intelligent machines is a testament to what they can create. While not always considered to be legitimate, the work is relevant to this generation how we are often combining both the physical world and the technological one.


**Fluid Definition of Digital Poetry**
Memmott argues that digital poetry resists a fixed definition due to its diverse forms and mediums. Terms like "hypertext," "cybertext," and "net.art" are used to describe various digital poetic practices, but these labels are seen as temporary and context-dependent. The defining characteristic is that the work is "digital" and is considered "poetry" by its creator or audience.

**Diversity of Digital Poetic Practices**
The chapter highlights the vast array of technologies and platforms used in digital poetry, such as HTML, JavaScript, Flash, and virtual environments like MOOs and MUDs. Each medium offers unique possibilities for poetic expression, leading to a wide range of poetic experiences.

**Material and Performative Aspects**
Memmott emphasizes that digital poetry is not merely a transition from print to screen but involves new material and performative dimensions. The interaction between the user and the digital medium—akin to a musician playing an instrument—plays a crucial role in the poetic experience.

**Individual Practitioner’s Poetics**
The chapter suggests that digital poetry should be understood through the lens of individual practitioners' approaches. Even works using the same technology can differ significantly based on the creator's intent and execution, highlighting the importance of considering the specific context of each work.

**Signifying Harmonics and Playability**
Digital poetry expands the boundaries of textuality by integrating visual, auditory, and interactive elements. This multimodal approach requires active participation from the reader or user, who engages with the work through interaction, thus co-creating the poetic experience.

Memmott's chapter challenges traditional literary criticism by presenting digital poetry as a dynamic and evolving field that defies simple categorization. It calls for a more nuanced understanding that appreciates the technological, performative, and individual aspects of digital poetic works.



**Questions:**

Defining Electronic Literature questions:

What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
A: 

How are those elements meaningful?
A:

How are the works read differently from print literature?
A: Well to start, the relationship between author and viewer is vaslty different, with E lit having an almost co piolt when the present their work, paritucarly if it is interactive, which allows individuals to make thier own decisions and turns it from a one sided read to a multifacted choose your ouw story. The next and most obvious point would be the medium in which it is presented, Print literature as the name suggests is a phyiscal copy of a peice of work, whilst E lit is a computer-based work (there is a lot more involved than just that, but the jist of where the work originates is correct). The most important part however is how a work is read. If I was to try and picture shade for example as a print version, I would have to assume that such a book would be targeted to a younger audience. I cannot see how you would be able to achieve such a thing in a small print book - maybe in sections you can fit in an if scenario where the reader writes different options which corralte to a certian derective, but even then it would make for such a clunky read. Similar thing for the others - 'the gathering cloud' could potentially work in a poetry book with the images overlapping already, first draft revolution could be done as a multi part series with every option a new book to experince how ceritan responses can change an outcome. Taroko Gorge would also have a similar problem seeing as it uses 

How is electronic literature different from print literature?
A:

What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?
A:





### Exercises 

I give a more definite definiton below of both but here I will broaden the scope of that understanding.

What is an algorithm? 
A: 

What is a constraint?
A:

Can you think of ways you might already be using these in your writing? (e.g., tools, techniques or processes that constrain and sytematise the way you write)?
Why were the Oupilo writers so interested in the intersection of maths and literature?
A: 

How does algorthmic writing make us think differently about authorship?
A: It plays into the idea that nothing is truly ours if all of it exists in some form already.

What aspects of the remix are the same?
A: For all three, font, textual size and colour remain the same. None of the structual coding has been changed.

What aspects of the remix are different?
A: Wording, and style choice have all altered.

Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
A:


#### Assignment 1
Analyse the form - only choose a few, 
do not have to look at the code more about how is it working from a reading point of view,
explore the idea and the questions we have about it as well as its relationship to E-lit 
articulating what it does, how it works, does it work?
draw on concepts in the readings - eg it's a first-generation

#### Algorithm and Constraint

Algorithm: An internal logic a system can follow as well as use as a foundation to answer questions.
Constraint: A limitation or restriction.



**The Dadaist Poem -** cutting up pieces of work and then rearranging them
Anna Hock was well-known for using this practice, and Bowie was also known to make music using a similar method.

**Lipogram meaning -** a composition from which the writer systematically omits a certain letter or certain letters of the alphabet.

**Example**

_Mushroom caps stuck on black wrought iron,
Bogged-out houses filled with scuttling bugs and sinking floors.
But in the building, ghosts roam displacing and absorbing the prior,
Human Kind isn't immortal._


**Mesostics -** a poem or other text arranged so that a vertical phrase intersects lines of horizontal text.
**John Cage -** very experimental with form. Creating his own rules for his compositions. played a cactus, has a song with 4 minutes of just silence.
