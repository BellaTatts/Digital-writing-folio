# Week 3 

Looked at readings - Indistinguishable from Magic: Invisible Interfaces and Digital Literature as Demystifier and Beyond Taxonomy: Digital Poetics and the Problem of Reading

### reading 1 -  (Emerson, Lori. Reading Writing Interfaces: From the Digital to the Bookbound, University of Minnesota Press, 2014. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/rmit/detail.action?docID=1680083.)

"All of these interfaces share a common goal underlying their designs: to efface the interface altogether and so also efface our ability to read, let alone write, the interface, definitively turning us into consumers rather than producers of content." 

Technology by the way of umbicomp is the third wave of computing and is embedded in our everyday life rather than just on a computer screen. This form of technology is commonly referred to as ubiquitous computing, which uses more natural interfaces to interact with humans.

Mark believed umbicomp was the antidote to Windows and desktop computing now digital writing is being considered as the anitdote to the invisible nature of umbicomp.





### reading 2

Electric Line: The Poetics of Digital Audio Editing
Martin Spinelli

Defining Electronic Literature questions:

What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
How are those elements meaningful?
How are the works read differently from print literature?
How is electronic literature different from print literature?
What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?

### Exercises 

What is an algorithm? What is a constraint?
Can you think of ways you might already be using thesein your writing? (e.g., tools, techniques or processes that constrain and sytematise the way you write)?
Why were the Oupilo writers so interested in the intersection of maths and literature?
How does algorthmic writing make us think differently about authorship?
Pen and Paper

Use pen and paper in applying the following processes and constraints. Take a photo of the results or transcribe them and add them to your folio.

What aspects of the remix are the same?
What aspects of the remix are different?
Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

Assignment 1
analyse the form - only choose a few, 
do not have to look at the code more about how is it working from a reading point of view,
explore the idea and the questions we have about it as well as its relationship to E-lit 
articulating what it does, how it works, does it work?
draw on concepts in the readings - eg it's a first-generation

#### Algorithm and Constraint

Algorithm: An internal logic a system can follow as well as use as a foundation to answer questions.
Constraint: A limitation or restriction.
Restrictions on poetry writing,


The Dadaist Poem - cutting up pieces of work and then rearranging them
Anna Hock was well-known for using this practice, and Bowie was also known to make music using a similar method. 

Example: <img width="394" alt="Screen Shot 2025-03-19 at 4 21 24 pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e36e24a1-1847-4264-af99-880955594b7c" />


Lipogram meaning - a composition from which the writer systematically omits a certain letter or certain letters of the alphabet.

Example
Mushroom caps stuck on black wrought iron,
Bogged-out houses filled with scuttling bugs and sinking floors.
But in the building, ghosts roam displacing and absorbing the prior,
Human Kind isn't immortal.


mesostics - a poem or other text arranged so that a vertical phrase intersects lines of horizontal text.
John Cage - very experimental with form. Creating his own rules for his compositions. played a cactus, has a song with 4 minutes of just silence.


Have to choose a work from the Electronic Literature Collection - The Vine and the fish
