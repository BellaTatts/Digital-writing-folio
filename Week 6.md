proposal information here

Once we have completed a test image map - basic is okay, no need to overdo it! - then if you have attended all the classes so far and/or have otherwise kept up with the learning, the good news is that there is no more required new technology for you to learn.

Next Monday the tech content around writing games using platforms such as Bitsy and Inform 7 is optional. If you do not include those in your portfolio, you will not be penalised.

As we continue progressing towards Assessments 2 and 3, we will work with the tech tools that we have already been exposed to. There will be time during future classes, for example, for us to complete the author website portion of the folio requirement.
