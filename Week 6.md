Proposal start

From past weeks, I was leaning toward scroll animation, but have decided to instead use Twine as the coding medium for my story. 

Discuss what I thought I was doing (poem) and what I'm now doing, which is an AI story.
Discuss the use of chapbook - pros and cons and issues with coding, vs Harlow.

ALL PROTOTYPES ARE LINKED IN THE PROTOTYPES FILE AT THE TOP OF THIS FOLIO!

Ok so I am using Chapbook, which utilises different coding from others like Harlow or icecube. 

First I created the passages - I started with four and worked out how to link them.

So the coding for this part turned out pretty simple - as an example -  [[continue]] would allow the sotry to progress
[[Back]] would go back a page - if I wanted to go to particular page I could use [[continue->fleeing]].

After that I then attempeted to embed an image with the code, but each time I'd press play this would come up:

{embed image: "https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/nature-technology-harmony-generative-by-ai_893571-8408"}

Now the issue i realised was that in order for the coding to recongnise what i was trying to do it needed to be a J-peg or Png. 
so instead I altered it to adhere to those rules:

include issues + failures + successes

### Miro image map

I find it easiest to plan it out into parts rather than just beginning, middle and end. I have linked the Miro page below for easy access.

#### Past student works


I did have a look at the students' work from past classes and have broken each of them into three parts to answer the questions:

House on a hill

Snow Season 
Poetically and structurally, I found the work incredibly appealing, I enjoyed the use of hypertext and image transitions throughout the piece. I think that while the interactive elements were small, it was the visual components that helped to include the viewer in the story.

Stay Strong



How does it work? What does it do? How does the reader interact with the piece? What is conveyed by the digital work?
How does the digital affordance work with the piece’s themes? Does its function deepen the meaning and interpretation of the themes for you as a reader?
Think about: the relationship between imagery and text; how the text changes between readings; how movement acts in the work; the structure of the work; the technologies used.
How does this work make you reflect on your own ideas and what you might do for your own piece? Requirement for final folio write 250 to 300 (minimum) words on this (can be done any time this week)
See the slide deck on Canvas modules Jenny's Final Project
Read the contextual statements and consider how the form and function of each aspect of this piece feeds into the themes of the work.



### Readings 

#### Riddles

A critical approach to interactive fiction, as literature and game.

An interactive fiction game: a form of storytelling which requires the input of the viewer to direct the course of the narrative.

Discussed the condition of IF - often text-based, allowing users to control a character and influence the environment through command. 

Below is a simple graph which highlights the diegesis in its simplest form and the corresponding motions attached to it.

Whilst there are considered to be many version of IF worlds - in the sense that they cannot all fall under one banner - I believe that is because of the sheer breadth of If stories out there as well as the need to refuse binary terms that could make it a definite term that could be compared to something else.

Player characters and non player characters: The use of games as a way to create interactive fiction is most likely more well known then such things like twine and the general practise of electronic literature. For most interactive games allow for choice and decision making, but more than that they allow for character growth and connection that just a simple coded step by step game doesn’t allow. In simple terms it creates player agency and much like other interactive fiction brings a sense on ownership to the work/game. When we consider authorship once more games are different from interactive written fiction however both form a bond between the participants action and the resulting outcome. While NPC's are both sperate and a part of the PC, the IF world is reliant on the actions of the PC to create a ripple effect and thus charter the actions of the NPC. The quarry a game made in 2022, does this quite well. There are at least six playable characters in the story whose actions can create certain responses from the surrounding NPCS, whether that’s a positive or negative one. For this story the quarry requires emotional choices made by the player to create minute changes in responses from the NPC, while this might not be considered important in the long run - doesn’t really alter the different endings of the games, it is reflective of human nature and how one ending might have been considerably better if other emotional choices had been made.


**The two riddles:** Poetry and computerisation have been held in long standing of one another. But the true ancestor of interactive fiction would have to be the riddle or so they say. I found this chapter particularly enlightening as I'd never thought to consider riddles as a truly interactive piece.

_Quote:_ 

The connection between poetry and the computer has been noted before (Novak 1991; Pinsky 1995, 1997); one London newspaper has even declared that “interactive fiction is computer gaming's best parallel with poetry: complex, subtle, and these days absolutely unsaleable”

Poetry allows authors to convey emotional complexities and play with the modern issues of the time. Riddles require context which is hidden within the lines of language, often a times which is at opposition with one another, the example used: covered with eyes but it cannot see - a potato.

The reason behind the connection between the riddle and interactive fiction, would be the puzzle. The puzzle in laymen terms is what facilitates interactive fiction - to reach point A certain decision or points must be met by the reader/player/viewer. In a sense both riddles and interactive fiction require a solution, one that might not be given straight away or his hidden. 

_Quote:_ 

Literary riddles and interactive fiction are related in four important ways: Both have a systematic world, are something to be solved, present challenge and appropriate difficulty, and join the literary and the puzzling.




#### On Savoir-Faire: 

It is an interactive fiction which set in the mid 1700s where we follow a man called Pierre who coms under debt. Wanting to fix it he attempts to rely on a Lavori d'Aracne which is a system of magic to try and resolve his problem. 

It utilises the parameters of IF and is similar to the story Shade which forces the viewer to text different words and structure to move the story along. Interestingly enough, it almost reads like a text but has the components of a game. For the most part the story is progressive - you construct one light source and gain access to more complicated puzzles 

I rather enjoyed the use of magic the irony of it being all computer based. 

**Below I wrote down the key components of the game:**

• Linking Magic: The protagonist/player can "link" similar objects ie two mirrors - to create a corresponding action that performed on one has an affect on the other. This code is critical to how many of the gams problems are solved. 
• Puzzle-Focused:  The game known for its puzzle based challenges which require the viewers participation both creatively and laterally.

• Text Parser Interface: Consistent with interactive fiction, to progress the story typed commands are needed to interact with the magic world (e.g., "examine draw" or "link mirror to mirror").

While the commands are simple the responses may not be. Which makes the work unpredictable and thus enjoyable to play. 

I wonder if interactive fiction is becoming so popular because of this unpredictability that literature seems to have?
