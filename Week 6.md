Proposal start

From past weeks, I was leaning toward scroll animation, but have decided to instead use Twine as the coding medium for my story. 

Discuss what I thought I was doing (poem) and what I'm now doing, which is an AI story.
Discuss the use of chapbook - pros and cons and issues with coding, vs Harlow.

Ok so I am using Chapbook which utilises different coding to others like Harlow or icecube. 

first I created the passages - i started with four and worked out how to link them.

So the coding for this part turned out pretty simple - as an example -  [[continue]] would allow the sotry to progress
[[Back]] would go back a page - if I wanted to go to particular page I could use [[continue->fleeing]].

After that I then attempeted to embed an image with the code, but each time I'd press play this would come up:

Now the issue i realised was that in order for the coding to recongnise what i was trying to do it needed to be a J-peg or Png. 
so instead I altered it to adhere to those rules:

include issues + failures + successes

### Miro image map

I find it easiest to plan it out into parts rather than just beginning, middle and end. I have linked the Miro page below for easy access.

#### Bitsy
I had a look at Bitsy as well, but found the overall concept unnecessary for my project.

#### Past student works


I did have a look at the students' work from past classes and have broken each of them into three parts to answer the questions:

House on a hill

Snow Season 
Poetically and structurally, I found the work incredibly appealing, I enjoyed the use of hypertext and image transitions throughout the piece. I think that while the interactive elements were small, it was the visual components that helped to include the viewer in the story.

Stay Strong



How does it work? What does it do? How does the reader interact with the piece? What is conveyed by the digital work?
How does the digital affordance work with the pieceâ€™s themes? Does its function deepen the meaning and interpretation of the themes for you as a reader?
Think about: the relationship between imagery and text; how the text changes between readings; how movement acts in the work; the structure of the work; the technologies used.
How does this work make you reflect on your own ideas and what you might do for your own piece? Requirement for final folio write 250 to 300 (minimum) words on this (can be done any time this week)
See the slide deck on Canvas modules Jenny's Final Project
Read the contextual statements and consider how the form and function of each aspect of this piece feeds into the themes of the work.
