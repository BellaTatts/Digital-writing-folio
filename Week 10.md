Readings

This is a digital work by Judy Malloy that is an intimate look into her creative process. This project is like a digital remediation of the archival tradition, it compiles authors' drafts as well as papers to try and document Malloy's journey.

Malloy's has ten weeks of notebook entries which provide detailed insights into the development of her generative electronic manuscript. The entries are presented in a particular order, which greatly differs from the original set up which reflected a blog like format, which include images, code snippets, and reflections on the writing and coding processes. 

Throughout the notebook, Malloy discusses various aspects of her creative process, including:
	• Interface Design: Malloy looks at the inclusion of interface elements, and preliminary programming, and how they work together alongside her writing, and how they create an interactive experience for readers.
	• Narrative Development: Malloy's main character is Diana, she looks at her  early life and interactions, and how these are later on interwoven within the general structure of the work.
	• Generative Text Modules: She creates modules that one used generate phrases and sentences, allowing for a more interactive and evolving narrative experience for readers.
	• Image Integration: She uses images to to situate readers within th different times in the authors life.
Testing and Refinement: Malloy looks a lot at the trial phases of her literary work.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1732264d-dea9-4928-9a03-ff0919048d57)

Worked out how to create a github.io website - I first needed to save my story on Twine, create a new file with the main as the github.io making sure it is HTML, then once that is done create an index, go to setting then pages to make sure branch is main and root, then upload your twine file into the index and it will sync up to system.
